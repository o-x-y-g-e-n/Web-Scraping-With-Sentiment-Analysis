		<review-text>As someone who has given far too many f***s about far too many things their entire life, this book was exactly the wake up call I needed. Even as a child in elementary school, I would have a miniature meltdown when I got a bad grade or if a friend was mean to me that day. As an adult, I got better at hiding these emotional upheavals and intense reactions to the world around me, but they never really went away with my maturity like I had hoped. I took to heart every disheartening news article I read and every crappy thing that happened to me at work or in school. I'd let it consume me, because I was never told to live life any other way or that controlling my reactions was even remotely possible; I thought it was just a permanent part of my personality. I always knew that it was more of a vice than a virtue, but I felt like I couldn't fully control it.

Mark Manson's The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*** employs a witty use of profanity laced with satirical comedy that's bursting with philosophical wisdom. Much of Manson's inspiration originates from nihilists, Buddhists, Albert Camus, and Charles Bukowski, but he brings those philosophies into a more modern and palatable perspective. He reminds us that life is too short to react so passionately about every little thing. We have a limited emotional capacity, and we often squander it on reactions to mean-spirited people or unfortunate events, completely forgetting that, although we can't control the world around us, we can control ourselves. This book has empowered me to exercise control over my reactions.

Shortly after reading this book, my husband commented at how &quot;zen&quot; I've become. I'm no longer angrily venting to him about all of the various ways the world upsets me. I still allow myself to feel and talk about things that bother me (I'm not aiming to achieve nirvana as a Buddhist monk), but petty things no longer have a hold on me. I let the negativity wash over me now without letting it absorb into my soul, and my life has been much more enjoyable as a result.

I was so inspired by this book and its philosophy, that I wanted a permanent reminder for myself to further ensure that I use my f***s wisely from now onward. For my birthday, I got this simple, but meaningful tattoo on my right wrist. The ∞ symbol reminds me of the infinite nature of time and outer space, and the 0 on the bottom represents humanity's relevance to time and space as a whole. It can also be translated as don't make something (∞) out of nothing (0) or a reminder that there are infinite opportunities to give a f***, but that I will remain steadfast in giving 0 f***s about things that don't really matter.

If you're the type of person who's struggled to keep their temper in line or if you're like me and you find yourself on an emotional roller-coaster because you take every event in the world and within your own life to heart, I strongly encourage you to read this book. If profanity is so much of a problem for you, that you can't tolerate reading the first half of this book (the last half is much less profane) you're probably too narrow-minded to have taken away any of the many philosophical benefits this book offers.</review-text>

		<review-text>Much of the writing in THE SUBTLE ART OF NOT GIVING is tongue-in-cheek. Surprisingly, however, there is a lot in this book that is SERIOUS. I know, I know, with a title like that, it's hard to believe, but it's true. Mark Manson actually makes quite a few substantive, helpful points.

Mark makes it clear that he's NOT saying you should not care about anything. Not at all. What he is saying is that you should pick carefully WHICH things you care about: &quot;This book will help you think a little bit more clearly about what you’re choosing to find important in life and what you’re choosing to find unimportant.&quot; He's not suggesting we should be indifferent; rather, carefully deciding where to place our concern.

How you pick your top concerns has practical consequences. Mark gives a real-world example about a cranky person in the check-out line at the market. The elderly customer is making a big fuss about some minor thing. Why? Because they don't have anything else to occupy their time. If you don't have anything substantive to occupy your time, then it's trivial stuff that bothers you: &quot;Your ex-boyfriend’s new Facebook picture, how quickly the batteries die in the TV remote, missing out on yet another two-for-one sale on hand sanitizer—chances are you don’t have much going on in your life...&quot;

Mark suggests just picking a few big things--values and people that reflect your values: &quot;What I’m talking about here is essentially learning how to focus and prioritize your thoughts effectively—how to pick and choose what matters to you and what does not matter to you based on finely honed personal values.&quot;

Much of life is about solving problems. They are inevitable, and we shouldn't pretend that we can make them go away. The author has no kind words for those embracing victimhood: &quot;People deny and blame others for their problems for the simple reason that it’s easy and feels good, while solving problems is hard and often feels bad.&quot;

On a serious note, the author relates a horrific experience from his youth, when a drunken friend took a dare, jumped into a lake and drowned. &quot;The most transformational moment of my life occurred when I was nineteen years old.&quot; This tragedy led to a determination to change the direction of his life, and figure out what is most important: &quot;Oddly, it was someone else’s death that gave me permission to finally live. And perhaps the worst moment of my life was also the most transformational.&quot;

The last part of the book has a serious tone--quite different in tone than the first part of the book. This part of the book is more philosophical. The author refers often to a book, &quot;The Denial of Death,&quot; (which became a Pulitzer Prize winner.) In serious, heartfelt chapters, the author reflects on human existence, and our search for meaning in life.

All in all, I found THE SUBTLE ART to be a fascinating read. The author writes well, and the book is easy to follow. Don't be fooled by the title, however, a lot of this book is very serious.

		<review-text>There are a dozen of topics Mark goes through in this book. Some of the main themes are these:

(1) Choosing what to care about; focusing on the things/problems that are actually meaningful/important (= &quot;giving a f*** about the right things&quot;)
(2) Learning to be fine with some negative things; always aiming for positivity isn't practical, and is stressful in itself
(3) Taking responsibility of your own life; it's good for your self-esteem not to keep blaming the circumstances for your problems
(4) Understanding the importance of honesty and boundaries, especially in relationships
(5) Identity; it might a good idea not to commit strongly to any special identity such as &quot;an undiscovered genius&quot;, because then any challenges will make you fear the potential loss of that identity you've clinged to
(6) Motivation; how to improve it by accepting failure and taking action
(7) Death; how learning to be more comfortable with one's own mortality can make it easier to live

The first 20% of this book were a little bit boring to read, but after that, the experience was very absorbing. Just like Manson's previous book (Models), I will give this one five stars.

(BTW this book wasn't as humorous as I expected. It was much more a serious than a funny book to read. The final chapters, discussing the acceptance of death, made me actually a little bit tense and distressed.)</review-text>

		<review-text>I've been eyeballing this book for a while, and I'm glad I finally bought it. Let me preface this by saying I am not a huge reader or &quot;book person.&quot; I honestly can't tell you the last time I finished a book, but I finished this book from start to finish... in one evening!!! I even broke out the highlighter and started taking notes. This book is so thought-provoking, honest, and REAL. Manson cuts the crap and gets straight to the point, which I really enjoyed. However, some parts may be a little too straightforward for some people. [trigger warning] One section is blatantly titled &quot;Kill Yourself.&quot; Of course, Manson doesn't mean to actually kill yourself, but the section's title still caught me off guard. For me, most of the relevant information is throughout chapters 1-6. After that, Manson relates the information to anecdotes from his personal learning experiences and relationships. There are a few decent pages on relationship advice and the like, but my favorite parts were definitely in the first 2/3 of the book. Overall, I have already recommended this book to all of my friends and family members, so I recommend it to anyone reading this review, too!</review-text>

		<review-text>It's been a long time since I've read something that compelled me to write a review. I wish the result was a 5-star rating, but this was shockingly bad. This book could have been an essay or a series of posts on the author's immensely popular, best thing since sliced bread, yugely successful blog. Instead, and no doubt thanks to a Stephen King-like skill of verbal diarrhea, the world was treated to a WHOLE BOOK.

To be fair, towards the beginning, the book does bring up several interesting, thought-provoking concepts. The delivery is very amateurish, but that's the intent. I struggled with the verbosity of it, but at least I was considering the author's perspective. Some things I agreed with, others I did not, but I accepted them all as a valid point of view.

Then the book devolved into sheer idiocy. The exact moment where it started was when he described the moment he hit &quot;rock bottom&quot;. In his - clearly not entitled - world, that meant surfing friends' couches and using a computer to... start a business (and I guess he also looked for jobs and played a ton of video games). It was 2008 and the job market was bad, so when he did get a job, he quit after 6 weeks. I'm not judging, because I have better values than that :), but I did stop at this point and asked myself &quot;who is this guy again?&quot; Up until then I thought I was reading some sort of a psychologist who presented concepts we don't stop to consider in a simpler, more humorous form. He's not a psychologist. He's a blogger with an immortality project.

The most bizzare part (to me) is the last chapter, which amounts to nothing more than the author's musings on death and the inevitability thereof, complete with the description - in vivid detail - of how he rock climbed to a cliff on the Cape of Good Hope (later on it all of the sudden turned out there was a path). How he walked all the way to the edge, but not without detouring to share how most people would poop their pants 3 feet away from the edge and turn back. How he sat on the edge contemplating what death means, before finally getting up and walking back with a smile. It was a strange and wholly unnecessary chapter.

Based on the average rating, it seems the book has helped quite a few people. If it's helped one, it served its purpose. Unfortunately, my biggest takeaway was that in the time we live in, anyone with an opinion and Internet access can impart their wisdom on the world (myself included, clearly); some just do it on a grander scale.</review-text>

		<review-text>I'm here for the same reason you are - Chris Hemsworth's instagram photo. So I picked up Mark Manson's #TheSubtleArtOfNotGivingAF* and at first I thought it was a cute coincidence that Bukowski and Orwell are referenced in the first chapter, not because Bukowski's a mastermind but because it made sense since this book seems like a 3rd cousin to his flippant writing style and philosophy.

By the 3rd chapter I started wondering if &quot;New York Times BestSeller&quot; means anything anymore. This is getting a 2-star review from me on Amazon 😌

The word &quot;superficial&quot; comes to mind and not in a materialistic kind of way, but the way that means on the surface, like Buzzfeed articles and teenybopper listicles read: they graze the tip of an iceberg matter before they fear losing readers so nothing ends up a fully researched and well-written point, instead one-liners and memes have replaced the rest of what could have been a good article.

Manson's whole book is like all his blogs pieced together, and none of them are long-form. Peppered with the overuse of f-bombs which I was offended by not because of the vulgarity, but because he butchers the art of using profanity to drive a point home. Every time I read a bad book I think it's time I write one myself, then I remember how long it takes me to write an email or over-wordy Instagram post and realize I don't have 11 years to spare. #aspergerproblems</review-text>

		<review-text>I ordered this book through Audible, and would listen on my drives to and from work. I still had an hour left to the book and couldn't bring myself to listen to the rest. Everytime I would get out of the car, I would wonder why on earth I was still listening.

I don't have an issue with the profanity &amp; vulgarity. What I couldn't get past is that it seems as though the book is just a bunch of examples of how messed up our society is, and the boasting of how promiscuous the writer was. I was expecting some form of how to work through the things that bother you and how to not care as much.

The writing is shallow, repetitive, condescending, and I wouldn't expect it to be relatable to most people, especially if you have your stuff together. It's a montauge of terrible personal experiences to make you feel better about yourself, and to hate society, and millennials.

I returned the book for a different one, just wished that I would have not expected it to get better and gave up a long time ago. Don't waste your time.</review-text>

		<review-text>I curse as much as a normal person, but this guy curses in some attempt to be edgy. it's like that high schooler that learned a few curse words then over uses them over and over and over again, cursing every other word. The following is from the book: &quot;While not giving a eff may seem simple on the surface, it’s a whole new bag of burritos under the hood. I don’t even know what that sentence means, but I don’t give a eff. A bag of burritos sounds awesome, so let’s just go with it.&quot; Replace the &quot;eff&quot; with the curse word, and that's pretty much the cadence of the book. Really. :|

His basic message seems to be some sort of mash-up of Zen philosophy but rehashed to make it sound like something a frat boy would say while exhaling bong smoke. :::blows out smoke:: &quot;yea man, I just started my web blog and now i have a successful book about how not to give a eff&quot;. im only somewhat joking. he actually does mention in the book in a humble-brag way how he sold all his stuff, moved to south america, then made it as a blogger all because, supposedly, he didn't give a eff. (survivorship bias anyone?)

It's dumbed down writing, and I'm not sure who the intended audience is. :\ Bros that like giving each other high fives? I dont know, dont mean to be so negative, but man, this is the NUMBER ONE book on amazon right now, I wasn't expecting a web-blog in book form.</review-text>

		<review-text>I understand why this book was a New York Times bestseller and sold millions of copies and every entrepreneur should buy it and read it to understand themselves and to make sure they are not blocking their own success. Yes, you hear that well, in most of the case, your failure is your fault because you are entitled.

Success depends on how w are conditioned to measure success, it depends on our metrics.
This book confirmed me that I was using the wrong metrics to measure my happiness and my success. I changed many things, but still, I have a serious way to go

Using the wrong metrics make sure we stagnate at some point in our life. personally or business wise. Creating anxiety &amp; self-doubt. Everyone has it.

Do you know friends, or maybe yourself, who love to become an entrepreneur or launch a new product and they keep talking about it and you have the impression they/ you don’t do anything about it? Lacking motivation?

It all comes down to our mind which is wired to go the easiest route. The choice of Status Quo is easier than trying. The choice of not starting (and not having failures) is easier than a possibility to have success.

This book explains more in details and gave great, unconventional, examples. The book is probably one of the most interesting books to read if you want real success and happiness</review-text>

		<review-text>my mom has a loving heart that puts other peoples need in front of her own. sometimes she forgets that we all need to take care of our own health before we can invest in other people in a healthy way. this book helps remind us that we too count. everyone ca n help but if its creating a strain of unhappiness, its time to minimize the impact letting others take your time. its time that you control and can choose to not create thin ice for your self. I m hoping this book helps others in self preservation. limited number in a lifetime. how many do you have left? With a limited number left, , this book helps identify you are worth saving a feel for yourself.</review-text>

		<review-text>Just stop worrying about what others are saying, thinking, feeling, and doing......you've got to stop giving a F if you want to be successful in any area of your life. This is one of my top 10 reads and I wouldn't hesitate to read it again. So many books on inspiration and self improvement want you to spend tireless hours doing journaling, meditating, and self awareness exercises.......when what it comes down to is you've just gotta stop doing what you're doing!!! I love Mark Manson!!

He's Real .... He's Raw....and he's the kinda guy I could hang with and truly feel that I've gained some kind of elevation. I have nothing but respect for people who shoot from the hip and are direct like this....

Well written!!</review-text>

		<review-text>Luckily I bought this on Audible so I was able to return this with ease! TSAONGAF starts art ok, it's an exciting premise, don't give a f*#k! Wow, yes, right on! But the authors examples are long stories, stretched to prove a point and fill up pages I feel. After the first third was over and the author talks about visiting 50 countries and banging chicks every night, it gets really tiresome. Couldn't even finish this title. The Subtle Art could also be an updated, more profaine version of Don't Sweat the Small Stuff. I'd be curios to see the age ranges of the different star ratings as I am mid 40's. This might appeal to a younger audience.</review-text>

		<review-text>It is an ok book.
The flagrant over use of ☆*☆* is amusing for the first few paragraphs. After that it just sounds like that annoying drunk at the bar the will not shut up.
Many useful analogies and stories are lost to useless interjections and elementary style writing.
The dust cover makes for an interesting conversation piece; that's about it.</review-text>

		<review-text>Not a verified purchase, as this book was gifted to me by a co-worker this Christmas. He told me this book &quot;changed his life&quot; and he thought I'd get a lot out of it. Well, I did get something out of it for sure - a good chuckle (as well as a glimpse into the emotional development of my co-worker). Now don't get me wrong, there are some decent principles in this book: staying away from social media, putting effort into things that actually matter, being willing to suffer for things you really want, etc - but nothing even remotely earth shattering for anyone with any sense of self-awareness. The part that made me laugh was the irony in the book itself. Manson talks a lot about entitlement in this book and at one point speaks of a hypothetical 25 year old billing himself as a life coach, without having really lived any life at all. He talks about how entitled and delusional this character is, all the while missing the fact that he is a 32 year old bro who's lived a privileged life, who’s been loved and supported by his parents and bankrolled through college and while circumventing the globe. He is a finance major with absolutely no education or experience in psychology, someone who has only begun to live and not yet experienced any of the truly devastating losses that others have endured. And here this dude is writing a self help book, telling all of us how we should be living our lives. Manson says none of us are special, we’re all totally run-of-the-mill, but he somehow thinks he’s special. So special that at 32, with no real experience in anything, he’s solved all of the mysteries of the world. He alone knows the key to true happiness. That elusive thing that humans have been striving for since the beginning of time? Yep, Mark Manson figured it out. Talk about entitled and delusional! The author comes across as an arrogant, over-inflated, self-congratulatory windbag with a penchant for way over-stating his appeal to the opposite sex. Yeah, yeah, I know it's a #1 New York Times Best Seller, but look around you. We live in a world where the Kardashians are idolized and Donald Trump was elected President. Clearly we're off the rails.</review-text>

		<review-text>While I've seen other authors describe the concepts in this book with much more detail, and I feel silly for falling for the title's marketing gimmick, I'd be remiss if I didn't say I enjoyed the modern perspective. Moreover, it serves as a good reminder of many concepts I've come across in the past, and I appreciated how easy it was to get through the entire audio book. In sum, I would recommend this to anyone who's having a hard time getting through the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People or anyone who can use a reminder of the role principles, values, death, and trust, should play in our day to day lives.</review-text>

		<review-text>Honestly the only thing I am going to give him credit for is the title. His attempt at using historical figures in pop culture to illustrate his point was futile and pedestrian. He never gave the so called secret recipe at the end. Although he claims that he does not value a promiscuous lifestyle, he constantly brags about sleeping around. His values changed from conning women into sleeping with him to conning or misleading the public into buying his anticlimactic fanfic</review-text>

		<review-text>I liked the ease of reading this book. Understanding the concepts of prioritizing things in the life. We have choices. And no matter what we choose, we are gonna problems. I think that was the biggest lesson for me. Life is never perfect. We should take the good with the bad. And we shouldn’t skip over the bad just to continue feeling good. It’s amazing how simple the lessons were but how we just never put things in to prospective.</review-text>

I've often said that we're all going to die, and that too much is taken too seriously. What's the old saying? Will what is happening now matter in 5, 10, 100 years. The answer is usually no.

		<review-text>A must read! Will teach you how to handle things that are much more important than the irrelevant once. Will make you realize A LOT of things like youve never thought that theres much more umportant problem than with what ur dealing right now. I hvent finish it yet but reading 5 chapters really made me reevaluate my relationship with my thoughts and shifted me out of crappt mental state. I highly suggest this book!</review-text>

		<review-text>This is the bro-iest thing I've read in a while. Mark Manson seems to just be working out his own sh*t by writing this book, which is a hodgepodge of other more meaningful philosophies sprinkled in with phrases like &quot;Jennifer Aniston's t*ts&quot;. There was obviously no thought that a woman might read this. I'm annoyed that I spent the money on this thing - it's terrible.</review-text>

		<review-text>I would like to thank Mark Manson for writing such a helpful book. Although he kindly emphasizes in his book that his views may&amp;will be surpassed in time, I presume, at least on my behalf, that his views may always serve as building steps for a better life. I consider his book as a vital compass which will help the reader to stay away from so many pitfalls considered as “succes” by so many...</review-text>

		<review-text>Never has a book led me to examine my thought processes and filters with which I interpret the world more so than this one. The author has such a simple, relatable way of explaining topics that many believe to be very complicated and only suitable for a high level philosophy class. Crazy to realize the idiotic pressures over trivial things we put on ourselves as we go through life.</review-text>

		<review-text>Meh. It's a frat boyish take that's three times longer than it needs to be. It's clear the author had to pad the pages in order to get this thing published. And he tries to be too snarky and clever by a half. I set it down after 30 pages.

		<review-text>This book was a waste of money for me. The writing is repetitive and shallow with the constant use of the F bomb. It was b-o-r-i-n-g... I have read at least a thousand books over the years and this one sits right at the bottom, in my opinion. The author's main philosophical premise upon which this book is based could be succinctly stated in a few paragraphs. Instead he stretches it out for 200 pages. I would give it a negative star if I could.</review-text>

		<review-text>I always thought I had a decent worldview but I've realized that I'm incorrect. This was proven multiple times from this book. The only reason I gave four instead of five stars is because of some contradictions that occurred in the book.

		<review-text>I like Mark's work. I find it refreshing in an age of repeats and regurgitations from countless news sources or gawker articles.

This book was good in the same vein. A refreshing take with new ideas and some half baked as well(thus the 4 stars).

Overall good book for reading and taking a look at your life.</review-text>

		<review-text>I’m not one for self help books but read this at the recommendation on my sister. It was very straight forward.

		<review-text>The title is almost click-bait. Maybe that's the subtle genius of it though as it hints at what it is by telling you what it isn't. A good read that feels more like a pep talk than a self help book. I really enjoyed it.</review-text>

		<review-text>Reading this book really helped get me out of a funk. This was the first self-help book I've read, so I can't compare it to others, but it's got a thumbs up from me.

		<review-text>A really great book with tons of deep introspective thought. I bought the audio cd because I like to listen to books on the way to work. This one was the best audio book that I have heard so far. There is a lot of really deep introspective thought here. The title may not imply as such, but I think the author did a great job of visualizing his viewpoint on life and happiness. This book is so much better than the regular 'You can do it&quot; self-help book. The author is clearly authentic and just sharing his views, which is refreshing in comparison to the many other &quot;scammy&quot; self-help authors out there.</review-text>

I learned that as humans we are all subject to problems, but I can trade my old problems for better ones, provided I take responsibility for my decisions. I had to highlight many chunks of the book since so much of it was personally valuable. I can revisit what I highlighted and remind myself I can give a f&amp;$k about some things as long as I choose the best path.</review-text>

		<review-text>I read this for a book group so had not researched prior to purchasing. I found this to be a superficial silly book that must be geared toward young adults/teens with the shock and awe aspect of the language. When near the end - as he was espousing the wisdom of death - he reveals he has just entered his 30's, I had to laugh. I think the author will be quite embarrassed by this book when he becomes an adult (unless of course it made him a boatload of money). I especially laughed at the section of &quot;honest relationships&quot; as he discussed his wife's disappointment that he had not appreciated her outfit for an event and she had to go change. Wouldn't a non-chauvinistic and less entitled perspective have been that women should dress for themselves, and not have their identity and self-value linked with how a man/husband/friend sees them? A very silly book indeed. Might be a good book for discussing the immature attitudes of young American males.</review-text>

		<review-text>I can't give this fewer than five stars because Mark Manson has been paramount in changing my outlook on life. Only downside is a good fraction of it is literally copy and pasted directly from his own blog, as though that was the template/outline for the book, so if you've been an avid reader of his blog before buying this book, you might be a little disappointed. But yet again, if you are an avid reader on the blog, you obviously like Manson's writing enough that it doesn't matter.

I really wish Manson weren't so ashamed of his past. His old/classic pick-up articles (circa 2010-2012) were blunt and very much tied to his 20s-self, but brilliant and unique; truthfully, THAT is where he changed the industry. He's extremely reflective, but those articles ARE the reason he is where he's at today, not because he was discussing soft talking points about how it's not of a high value system to have indiscriminate sex (which he mentions in this book). Not only has he removed all of his old articles from the blog, but his talking points are now suggestive that he's trying to bury his past.

One point in the book that stood out to me was: &quot;I know for myself, quitting my day job in finance after only six weeks TO START AN INTERNET BUSINESS ranks pretty high up there in my own “didn’t give a fudge” hall of fame. Same with deciding to sell most of my possessions and move to South America. Fudges given? None. Just went and did it.

Same quote from his original blog:
&quot;I know for myself, quitting my day job in finance after only six weeks and telling my boss that I was going to start selling dating advice online ranks pretty high up there in my own “didn’t give a fudge” hall of fame. Same with deciding to sell most of my possessions and move to South America. Fudges given? None. Just went and did it.&quot;

^^ - Now I mean, on the surface, who cares. But, really, what's that about? Why soften it? Why the fear about just being real about what the past was. Mark would probably rebut/rationalize with 'but the scope of what i've been doing with the internet and my writing has evolved so extensively that the original reason is no longer the full truth.'

------------

My point being: Mark, if you're reading this, some new talking points for additional writing could be exploring why you might be burying your past. It's interesting seeing and following your evolution as a writer and person, but from the reader perspective, it seems as though you're putting forth a lot of effort to essentially erase the 'player persona' as if it never existed (at least it comes off that way in your writing!).

A lot of us would really like to know HOW YOU WERE ABLE TO commit/change your mindset in order to get married, because even if a marriage/relationship is fulfilling to be in, how do you ignore urges and justify the decision to marry? **This question is less about why one would be in a relationship, and more about how to say no to red pill urges. Because do they ever go away?** I mean, do you have an actual mechanism through which you could be in a coffee shop somewhere and legitimately not want to talk to a new girl. If this is a question of not getting esteem through that type of behavior anymore, could you please explain? Are the urges still there but you simply don't act out of respect for the relationship?

I also think you should have an archived section of all of your old writing for subscribers only. I think you should ask yourself why you took it all down. Anyway, you're my favorite author though and changed my life, which is why I took the time to write this.</review-text>

		<review-text>Quite a remarkable book by someone barely out of his 20's. I'm interested in books that explore how our actions are sabotaged by our screwed up minds and emotions. The book,The Power of Now made a certain amount of sense but was very confusing to me and somewhat painful to read. This book, with its profanity and anecdotes made perfect sense. A profound book that is easy and enjoyable to read.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is one of the best books I have ever read. The information that is in the book is to scary and at the same way helpful. In the middle of reading this book I felt like, then what is the point on living? Why just don't die if we are going to do it anyways. I started to feel strange inside of me. I was scared because everything he writes about Is true. We all try to hard on impressing people. Try hard to make big goals and try to achieve them. But in the end we do it not for ourselfs we do it for the attention we will get in the result for that. We are not special, but in the same time we are. We are all unique bit not more special than the others. We live our life trying to be &quot;successful&quot; and convince ourself that it is because we want it for us. But in some cases we are not. We (and when I mean &quot;we&quot; I mean myself) try so much to achieve goals working hard everyday trying to come closer to that goal. But when I readed this book my eyes opened. I was wrong. I was not doing it for myself. I was doing it to prove others I am worth of their attention. Because I wanted to feel special because yeah. I always said to myself &quot;nobody work hard enough for success so I am special I work harder than the others and that is why i deserve it more&quot;. I was every day working hard, I did not want to accept it but when I readed this book it really hurted me. I felt like he was 100% seeing through me. I felt like my life was pointless. All I did, the goals I was pursuing was only to make other think in the future. &quot;Wow he is special. He worked hard to obtaining he's goals. He is inspiring&quot;. I wanted to show the people that made me feel bad about myself see me in the future and look up on me and say to themselves. &quot;Well I think I am the real loser&quot;. But in this book I began to think. I was always looking at other people judging them about being at their 30-40 having a s***ty job, family, complaining about everyone and everything etc. Or the ones on my ages always working hard, making fools of themselves trying to get the attention of others. Or people screaming at others just to feel like they are better than the other person. I always felt sorry about them. When reading this book I realised I am exactly at them. We live our whole life trying to be somebody. When the real thing we should do is try to be the person we want to be. But it is not easy. The society always look up to successes and winners but never at the ones that are not that &quot;successful&quot; but are happy. And that make us all feel like we are not enough. Which we think is true. We give fu*ks about so many things that are not really important and that does not mean anything at all. The fact that we are going to die is terrifying. Not because we don't know what comes next, it's because, we thing yeah if we all will die then what is the point of trying? That's the reason this book is good it does not just make you unsure about all your beliefs. It also makes you realise that it does not mather at all if you are going to die. The real problem is what you should care about while you are alive. The old lady crossing the road in the pace of a turtle. Or the really fact that we are alive and are able to choose what we want to care about.

Why did i writte a so long post? Well because if this can help somebody in my situation it will be nice. And the other reason was for myself. Because even if I say I don't care I actually care about what others think about me, and even if you don't know me in person. Knowing someone readed this and got the inspiration to read the book then it's enough for me. To feel like I did something good.

And the third reason is because I liked the super hero &quot;Disappointed Panda&quot;. He is cool and I would like a hero like that. Instead of the false super heroes that lies to others just to get liked by them.

So this is an executive book. It gives a new way to look at things. I really recomend it for the people that are tired of this world and the humans on it, and even worst that tries way to hard to imprese those humans you hate, because you were told that is the right way to fulfill yourself. &quot;You should do like the rest&quot;,they said. It does not help in the long run. It have never and will never!</review-text>

		<review-text>I don't usually leave reviews unless something was absolutely the worst or exceptional. Lucky for you, this book is the latter. This book is absolutely hilarious with its witty quips and side notes. Mark Manson is a really great story teller and he doesn't waste anytime on the fluff. I've read many a self-help book, but this is the first one that felt user friendly. If you're like me and have been trying to think so positively and be so accepting that you swear rainbows are coming out of your butt yet still find yourself unfulfilled, this book is for you! The title says it. It's time we all stop caring about which Kardashian is dyeing their hair purple and put our efforts into something more meaningful. I'm not going to tell you that you'll be a better person after reading this book, but i will tell you to be prepared for an existential crisis. I could go on and on about how much I love this book, but just trust me when I say this, it is awesome.</review-text>

		<review-text>Good book. The blurb on Manson's previous book, Models, said it was the last PUA book you'll ever need, and the guy who wrote that was right. I haven't bothered with PU stuff since and haven't needed to (nor will I ever again). This book is much the same, only for self-help books. The advice boils down to: get over yourself. And all the subtle mind games we play on ourselves when we get too self-involved. A lot of the stuff Manson wrote covers ground I was already figuring out for myself, but as a recovering narcissist I have to say it's nice to have some outside confirmation. Good job, Mark.</review-text>

	<review id="553">
		<review-text>This is an excellent book. But it is a counter-intuitive way of thinking and reacting. It mainly teaches/explains how to care and not care about specific things.</review-text>
		<review-year>2017</review-year>
	</review>
	<review id="554">
		<review-text>It took me a while to read this book, to be more precise about 2-3 months. Not because of the book, but because of many other distractions in life. However, under normal circumstances I would've ended the read and moved to another book despite not finishing it. But something about this book kept me going back to it.

The book (I cannot use it's name as Amazon rejected due to profanity despite the asterisk) is an interesting read with some great insights into your life and philosophy about living your life by helping yourself avoid stress. The book has nine chapters. Of all these chapters, the most remarkable chapter, and the one that kept my mind fully and philosophically focused, was chapter 9 &quot;... And Then You Die&quot;. If this was a book where skipping chapters was something that author encouraged for one reason or another, then Chapter 9 would have been my advice to you to read. But because this book discusses how to focus on your life and how to filter what is relevant to you and what is not, chapter 9 would sound like an everyday big-headed discussion on life. Each chapter has an interesting point to make. Some of the points might be something that you are already aware of but you were not thinking about it or you thought you might be the only one focusing on it, there is something to learn and to keep you thoughts engaged.

So why four stars? At times the author lost my attention. Although most of the book is trying to keep you focused and engaged, I found it on a couple of occasions that my mind was flooded by some irrelevant things.</review-text>

		<review-text>So I am &quot;trying again&quot;. I used the TITLE word altered as it is on the book cover, yet my review was rejected as inappropriate. So hear goes again. WOW! This is a great look of philosophy and leadership. Manson reminds his readers that it is inefficient to even try to care about everything. But it does not mean being indifferent. Manson contends that when doing the right thing, a person just can't give too much concern to adverse consequences, whether is being threatened to lose a job, or getting an unfavorable review. Reminds me a lot of the West Point cadet prayer, which advocates &quot;Make us to choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong, and never to be content with a half truth when the whole can be won. Endow us with courage that is born of loyalty to all that is noble and worthy, that scorns to compromise with vice and injustice and knows no fear when truth and right are in jeopardy.&quot; This can be an excellent viewpoint when individuals are forced to lead from the middle.</review-text>

		<review-text>Well, I just finished the book. There were several instances throughout reading where I thought of how I would review it when I was finished, but having closed the back cover here is what I'll offer;
For starters, this is the first book I've bought and read cover to cover in less than one week, in a long time. Not only that, but I was inspired to also read directly from the book to my family and my girlfriend. This book has a lot to offer. To anyone. For everyone. If you're a follower of Mark's blogs you're already familiar with the kind of no bulls*** sincerity he writes with. not only does this book deliver in the same likeness, Mark also put his mind and heart in between these pages.</review-text>

		<review-text>I used to have serious social anxiety problems. Like panic attacks and all that. I had been sort of developing this way of thinking over time as I dealt with my underlying issues, but this book puts what I was thinking into words in a way I never did. It gets a bit long winded and I honestly haven't finished it yet, but I really identify with the author's view and it was helpful to hear this thing I had just been vaguely feeling put into words. I highly recommend it.</review-text>

		<review-text>I had never heard of Mark Manson up until I saw a stranger reading this on the train during a particularly stressful time in my life. I googled it and read Mark Manson's manifesto on his website and I was hooked.
I ordered the book and I've never had any other book do such an adjustment on my attitude in over a decade. It's done wonders in terms of bringing me out of a deep depression and helping me to cope with anxiety issues, and it's really just so chock full of gems that I don't know where to start.
Read the title; does it seem like something that you'd be compatible with? If so, it's worth a read. If not, you already knew you didn't want this book. Just take off the cover sleeve if you're going to read it at work or church, it has a pretty classy black hardcover underneath.
Thank you, Mark Manson, for all of the help you probably didn't even realize you were giving when you wrote this.</review-text>

	<review id="695">
		<review-text>For anyone who follows Mark's blog, you will probably have already read about a third of the book. It reiterates a lot of common anecdotes from his life that he's already covered in his blog, such as his upbringing and his journey to becoming a &quot;digital nomad.&quot; It also brings up a lot of common themes from his website, such as the paradox of goal setting, and the value of acting over planning.

However, the beauty of this book lies in the extra insight he adds to each theme, and the familiar sardonic humor that he expertly intertwines into each page to keep you hooked. Yes, at some points I was kind of like, &quot;Ok, already read this post on his site, let's skim and move on.&quot; But at other points, such as his extrapolation on &quot;good&quot; values versus &quot;bad&quot; ones and not forcing yourself to be happy all the time, there's pure effing gold.

As a disclaimer, I usually hate self-help books. They always make me feel like that pathetic loser at the bar chugging a stiffy, all alone, unloading a diarrhea hurricane of narcissistic &quot;woe is me&quot; crap onto anyone unfortunate enough to be in earshot.

But I like to think of Mark's new book as more of a philosophy on embracing negativity and, as he says it, &quot;fighting the sh*t storm.&quot; He doesn't force you to trudge through lists of superficial ways to pretend that life is a golden egg made from rainbow unicorn piss and the creepy baby sun from the Teletubbies. He rather creates a framework for setting your own self-help agenda based off of your own values, not the other way around.

DEFINITELY recommend this book to people weathering &quot;the sh*t storm,&quot; or just in general feeling like you have no idea what the hell you're doing in life. He gives some unnecessary examples of his themes that are a little lengthy and deserve skimming, which is why I give it four stars instead of five. Other parts, though, you will want to tattoo to your body, because you'll want to refer to them over and over again as you deal with whatever drama you're dealing with that led you to consider reading this book.

Overall amazing and potentially life-changing read for all orientations, genders, ages (over 18 due to some swearing), and races!</review-text>

		<review-text>At age 20 I would have said this book was a great read but too negative or sarcastic in theory. Today at 66 I have found a great read that is so true to life it is scary. Better than any professor in Psychiatry could communicate, this book explains the way it is with humanity and the world.
Sensitive or naive world perspectives have to opportunity to see the wisdom in his words. What a talented author, even though I hate expletives in movies, I believe his use of F**## was easy to overlook to get to his brilliant points made all throughout.</review-text>

		<review-text>I really don't think I can properly express how much I enjoyed this book. If you are not easily offended and open to analyzing yourself, this book is for you. So much more is covered than lack of f's given. It's more about choosing the right f's to give.
I say thank you because a lot of work went into this book and I've learned so much from it. I've gushed about several topics to my friends and hope they read the book, too. Rather than being a how-to, this book can change the way you think about yourself if you let it. I'll be reading it again!</review-text>

		<review-text>As one of the many subscribers to Mark's blog, I think this book was definitely a good read. He does a good job explaining truths about life that aren't immediately obvious, as well as giving you realistic examples and stories. My favorite thing about his writing is his ability to give incredibly insightful advice in a down to earth, understandable way that sounds like a real person. My only gripe is that as a longtime reader, I recognized a lot of bits and pieces in the book were taken word for word off of certain blog posts. But ignoring that, they made sense in context, and it's all still great quality. If you've never read Mark Mason's work, there's no reason not to pick this up (unless you hate swear words THAT much), and even if you have this is still a great guidebook that's thought provoking all the way through.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book... I like this book. So, clearly, if you are offended by the f-word (will Amazon even allow it to be written out in full in a review? I'm not sure...) then you probably shouldn't read this book. However, it is more like a refreshingly blunt letting-go philosophy. It isn't really what the title might lead one to think it is. Some very good tips. One that I got a lot from is toward the front. I won't give a spoiler but it's good info. Very glad I ordered it and would pay full price again.</review-text>

		<review-text>I enjoyed this book, but for some reason I expected something more. (Not the author's fault I had higher expectations.) I think there is some solid advice in here. I appreciate his style of writing. I think it's both entertaining and perhaps a way people mired in the real world can gain access to some fairly spiritual (and dare I say Taoist) concepts. It's amazing Mark Manson produced something like this at a fairly young age. I look forward to how he grows and matures and what he shares along the road. I may even start reading his blog.</review-text>

		<review-text>&quot;This book will not teach you how to gain or achieve, but rather how to lose and let go.&quot;

I'm quoting the author here, but this is it, in a nutshell.

This short book will challenge you to reevaluate your standards, your values, your way of life, your relationships and your perspective on life (and death).

It will prompt you to dislodge yourself from the way things are and prompt you to ask yourself if this is what you really want. It will help you see effort, pain, fear and sacrifice in a new light. It will force you to grow up and own up to your decisions and mistakes.

I, for one, loved this book. It's written by someone who has been through life, who has failed and who has experienced success and true happiness. It's the result of a man's ability to see reality for what it is rather than a version distorted by personal projections.

Read it. It'll shake you.</review-text>

		<review-text>First of all, this book is an obvious money grab. It's just a beefed up version of his most popular blog post. There is no new information in the book, it's just been significantly lengthened with anecdotes, personal stories, and couple of studies that are only vaguely relevant to the topic at hand. Apparently even this wasn't enough to make something he could justify charging people for, so he also opted for large font, wide spacing, and thick margins. That did the trick. Now introducing... (drum roll)... The Exact Same Blog Post (Now 857% Longer)

As far as content, don't be fooled by the forced humor and edgy language, this is just another disposable, pep-talk style self-help book that follows the same basic formula as a thousand others, and provides no satisfying reasons to think the advice therein is worthwhile. Most of this book is comprised either of Mark pontificating on the keys to a happy life (based almost exclusively on personal experience) and/or ranting about &quot;our&quot; skewed priorities. Speaking of, the &quot;our&quot; was a major pet peeve of mine...

He speaks in the ubiquitous self-help &quot;we/our/us&quot; throughout the entire book. &quot;We fear,&quot; &quot;we want,&quot; &quot;we try,&quot; &quot;we always,&quot; &quot;we need to,&quot; &quot;we should...&quot; We who? You mean you? It's one thing to take truths of psychology or human behavior at large and assume they probably apply to one's self. It's another thing entirely to take truths about one's self (in this case Mark's self) and assume they apply to humanity at large. Mark spends the entire book doing the latter. Something worked or didn't work for him, did or did not make him happy,was or was not a profoun experience, so he insists we should all think/act/be/do the same.

Anyway, I know the edgy title has your interest piqued, so if you're dead-set on hearing what he has to say, I'm tellin' ya, just save yourself the four hours and $20 and just read the much more succinct source material.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is one that will help open your eyes to figuring out what matters most in your life.

For me, this book has placed me on a course to decide what matters most to me, and to reclaim my life. Highly recommended.</review-text>

		<review-text>I just lost my cousin, who is like my sister, to cancer, a very rare one. She was just about to turn 43. I also lost my brother at age 29 to a brain tumor, 16 years ago. I was feeling very depressed, sad etc. My cousin, Melanie, lived the message of this book, and when it showed up.on.my phone the other day, the day before her 43rd birthday, I thought what the F? Let's read it. I have never read a book on my phone but found myself with a free 30 minutes..this never happens..so I started reading and could not stop. It was like Mel sent me a book with all her messages..with her wisdom, I could hear her voice, saying it to.me. I am going to believe this is a gift from her and I am going to work at living.

		<review-text>I love reading Mark's articles and this book was even better. It's a quick read with good insights on focusing on the important values in life. We are what we value so if we are unhappy, chances are we are not valuing good things. It's not a book about caring less, it's more a book about caring less about stupid things that really don't matter in the long run. It made me think and I enjoyed reading it. A friend of mine who is a therapist thought it was amazing and also found it insightful. I highly recommend.</review-text>

		<review-text>Modern day stoicism at its best. Every driven person should read this. If you're not too squeamish about language, I'd even give it to kids 12 and up, especially if they are struggling with pressures in school or athletics. I'm 32 now, an international-level rugby player and amateur MMA fighter and wish I had read this 20 years ago. It's my most gifted book and I recommend it to all of my friends and family who aren't prudes and the f-bombs. From here you can go on to read Seneca and Marcus Aurelius with better understanding.</review-text>

		<review-text>I loved this book. Without being too crass, it's very humorous and tongue in cheek. The swearing isn't too excessive (for me, at least). And it's so inspiring. I loved the emphasis on acceptance, learning that the negative in life is actually a good thing you can learn and grow from. It's easy to read because it's not one of those aggressively positive self help books. It's the first book of this type that I feel I actually agree with everything in it. And I appreciate the author's honesty - He has messed up, he's had a rough life, but he's made the most of it. I love this book and will recommend it to everyone I'm close with. A+</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is absolutely wonderful! I should state, however, that the book is wonderful only if you are willing to take the honest look at yourself that it discusses. If you're going to argue with the insight and common sense approaches, then read something specifically written to stroke your fragile ego, because this book asks you to be real and honest and face possibly uncomfortable truths.

		<review-text>Bought this for my husband - He loves it!! Honestly, this is a great book for anyone who is having a hard time getting over something in life (like my husband and his sh*t family and all of their petty sh*t drama!). I learned about this book from the bonfire show on the comedy channel on XM radio, some comedian was talking about it and how it helped him get in the right 'you do you and ill do me' mindset (wish i remembered who the comedian was) but this book is great!! definitely get it and read it to cover-to-cover! The book is hilarious and really lays it out there, very matter of fact! (PLUS, the cover of the book is very bright and goes great in my overall bookcase-scape-design!) win-win!!</review-text>

		<review-text>I absolutely loved this book. His writing style was poignant and humorous to read. While many &quot;self help&quot; books spew all this BS about the pursuit of happiness blah, blah, Mark gives it straight up and in your face. If you are looking for a different approach to your view of life, relationships, career, hobbies, etc and how to make them more impactful, I encourage you to read this. It'll change your world. You'll feel more alive. He does say the F word ALOT in this book but it didn't bother me at all. Some people have said it deters from the message, but I disagree, I think it spices it up. It's brutal honesty.</review-text>

		<review-text>Once I endured the onslought of profanity, probably a way for Mark to enhance the ending, I was immersed in the shift of my own reality. Breaking into the subconcious layers of my mind's defenses, the new ideas of Mark's thoughts made a lot of sense. After a lot of stopping to digest the foundation of his theories, the new picture emerged and made sense.

This is the type of book that will take several readings to fully grasp all tne nuances he lays out as well as sorting out my reactions and self realizations which I hope to relegate into my daily life.

Thank you Mark for your contribution to the world.</review-text>

		<review-text>I've already read pretty much everything Mark has written in the self-improvement space - so there were no surprises in here for me, no major 'aha' moments. That said, it's a great compendium of his unique take on the world and it's nice to have all those thoughts in one, easy-to-access spot. And for all I said there were no surprises, my highlighter still got a very big workout</review-text>

		<review-text>This was my first book of 2017. It took a chapter or two to get used to his writing style but the stories and parallels are very clearly presented and the whole message of the book accessible. I found myself referring to it during conversations while I was reading it. I may even read again because it's the type of book that taps into your daily internal dialog and reminds you of what is essential productive thinking and what you really need to let go of; these things are constantly changing, aren't they? It's a great reset button for someone who is on the path to change.</review-text>

	<review id="1094">
		<review-text>When I first bought this book I didn't think much of it. I was a fan of his blog for a while and I had already read a handful of self help books before. Going into this I prepared myself to hear superficial adviced like &quot;smile more&quot; or &quot;visualize&quot;. What I got instead was a huge, hard to swallow pill, and a glass of salt to wash it down.
Even the &quot;all time great&quot; self help books can't hold a match to this giant house fire of a book. From the very beginning this book calls you out on your actions, and tells you that you're a whiny, entitled jerk. Afterwards it tells you that you're the source of your problems. As a whiny, entitled jerk you have superficial values that reinforces your entitlement, which in turn reinforces your whiny, jerky ways.
Where this book really shines though is instead of giving you some daily mantra, or telling you to work harder at your superficial goals, it tells you to quit the bulls*** and stop being such a whiny, entitled jerk.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book, as its name (and just about everything else) claims, isn't pulling any punches. Mark gives it to you straight.

For example:
- He says &quot;f that kid&quot; about a kid crying about the color of his hat (not in real life... I don't think)
- He says that if you want to be happy and in life, your response is so common it doesn't mean anything
- He calls everyone on the planet a &quot;finely ornamented ape&quot;
- When his wife asks if she looks good and she doesn't, he tells her so

And I could go on and on. The whole book is like this. And it's wonderful, and eye-opening. It's like having a conversation with a friend who is honest about stuff. I love it.

This book is NOT for everyone. I'm not going to buy a copy for my mom's birthday (sorry, Mark). But if you're the kind of person who likes a frank, analytical look at human nature? You should have read this book yesterday.</review-text>

		<review-text>I liked the simplicity of the message. I've read and listened to the greats in personal growth and I know message pretty good by now. While there is certainly nothing wrong and I encourage people to read and listen to those messages, its important not to get tied to any one way of thinking, without challenging it. I believe this book challenges the 'just think happy thoughts' mentality and gives you the straight dope. Stop trying to fix everything about you. You're actually doing the best you can and being told you have so many things wrong and a whole slew of books was written about you to help fix all those things, is a bit daunting, to say the least. I give it 5 stars because it challenged my thinking and made me ask whats really important in my life? I've stopped trying to be superman and fix all my issues. Sometimes the very things we think are the answers, are the very things that hold us back.</review-text>

		<review-text>I just finished reading the book and it was totally worth my time! I have read most of his articles on his blog and though some of it was repeated in this book, there is also a lot of fresh content. I gained some fantastic insights from this book particularly on healthy relationships, &quot;do something&quot; attitude, attitude towards pain and suffering, and being aware of emotional highs and confusing that with happiness. It is remarkable that the author was able to gather this wisdom based on his life experiences and able to present it in a compelling way!</review-text>

		<review-text>It's hard to say if Mark Manson changed my life. What I do know is that when trying to make decisions, from trivial to life-changing ones, or give advice to friends, I'll often refer to to the perspective and values in Mark's writing. This goes against his advice of being more skeptical, and this can freeze most people with indecision or analysis paralysis, but his other advice of Accepting Responsibility helps me make choices with full recognition of consequences much more calmly and with a more level head.

In reading his writing, I feel less lost. And when I still feel lost, I sit with my emotions, accept them, and kindly ask if they'd like some coffee or tea. Even the negative ones.

So thank you, Mark, for publishing this book. It's hard to imagine what can top this and Models, but I'm already looking forward to it.</review-text>

		<review-text>Arguably the greatest and most influential book I've ever read in my life. The counter-intuitiveness is the best component and what makes this book truly amazing. It goes against what we've learned and accepted generally within our society and presents us with key areas of focus to living a better life. A must read for anyone who truly wants to redefine their values, living a quality life, and eliminating the misconceptions that we commonly associative with living a good life</review-text>

		<review-text>Fantastic book. If you don't walk away with some profound realizations about yourself in this book then you really were not looking for personal improvement. I am way older than his target market and even I found it funny, inspiring and thought provoking. It is all a great read but Chapter 5 is a real kick in the pants.

I have now bought 7 of these to give to those I care for. Kids, wife, friends and family and there has not been one of them that has not walked away with the same feelings I had.</review-text>

		<review-text>I've been following Mark's blog for a couple of years. I love his sense of humor, his grounded insight, and everything he writes. This is probably the best self-help book out there. Its a no-nonsense, straight-forward, honest approach to evaluating yourself and the values you live by. Its helped me let-go of a lot of &quot;bulls***&quot; and focus on what is really important in my life. We only go around this world once.

		<review-text>I got a lot out of this book and sent a copy to a friend as well. When I hear the word &quot;values&quot; I often shut down because it makes me think of republicans and conservatives. But of course we all have values whether we are aware of them or not, and we prioritize certain values over others, which can create problems. Since reading this book I've become more aware of my own values, and how I am choosing to prioritize some of them over others, and considering whether or not that's getting me what I really want out of life. It is empowering to realize this, and that I can choose to focus on other values that might be more in line with the results I want.

I really like Mark Manson's work and since reading this have taken some of his courses on his website.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is a gift that I happened into-- I did not expect to run into it, and I was certainly looking for something more lightweight and self-help-y, that I could read &amp; mostly forget. I read most of it, then put it aside for a couple of weeks. I just had a lousy day, and finished the last 20 or so pages before sleeping. I'm impressed, and somehow looking at my values and life is OK. Good Book, actually useful in opening up my thinking, instead of telling me someone else's good ideas.</review-text>

		<review-text>Let me just save you a ton of money. No, Mark Manson is not Buddha nor is he Jesus Christ, but he DID accurately and succinctly sum up roughly 5 years of my much needed therapy sessions into this one small book. Feel like your life is a mess and you don't know where to turn? Start with this book first, THEN go get a therapist. There, I just saved you about $5K.

Yes, he says the f-word a lot, more so in the beginning of the book than near the end, probably to try and grab your attention. I don't care - it's what I hear in my workplace every day, it's what I hear from my friends all the time when we are sitting around in a bar having a beer. It's real. And so is his approach to life in this book. This is no &quot;everyone can do anything and be incredibly happy for their entire lives&quot; book; it's an honest look at what REAL life is, not the romanticized, happy, rainbows and unicorns drivel that we've been brought up with in the USA.

I've read this once; I'm going to now read it again and make a &quot;Cliff's notes&quot; version I can carry around with me and read - often. He seriously needs to sum up all the principals he talks about into a little cheat sheet that you can carry in your wallet and glance at whenever you are about to screw up your life again. Real talk - for real people. I loved it.

And if you think he's just spouting inanities that he made up, you can think again. The principals he outlines (again, succinctly) come from being widely read and internationally experienced. I don't know about you, but I don't really want to read Socrates, Freud, and Nietzsche - boring! But Mark uses humor to get some of their points across, and for me, the humor was what made it an interesting, quick read.

Mark's been blogging for years and I've always enjoyed his blogs; but for a first book, he did a great job of summing up a lot of his thoughts in one place.</review-text>

I'm impressed it was written by someone so young. I couldn't have written this in my 30s. Kudos to Mark.</review-text>

I wrote down several memorable quotes and I want to go back in for more. What I love most is that it is contrary to the typical self-help book. It gives good life advice while being totally honest about the ups and downs of life. Thanks Mark for writing a meaningful and much-needed book.</review-text>

		<review-text>If I could I would have given 10 stars! This is absolutely the most fantastic self help book which lays the truth out on you just like it is, without sugar coating anything. Majority of people already know solutions to all of our problems - we are just scared to say them out loud and act on them because we are afraid to hurt the other persons feelings or hurt our fragile ego. It's much easier to sit and do nothing and wallow in your own victimhood. We all are afraid of something without realizing that life's short and you need to not give a f%^* about your fears. Buy this book - you won't regret it!</review-text>

		<review-text>I have been reading Manson's blog for a while, and while the information is well organized and thorough, I felt as though I was just rereading several of his better articles from his blog. However, it is well written with a wry style that is what drew me to start reading his blog in the first place. This book is a perfect way to share a lot of the information that I learned from his blog with friends who are less willing to go through all the articles themselves. I have already bought two copies and given them both away.</review-text>

		<review-text>Manson is excellent through the first 75% of this book. The choosing what to care about is extremely helpful in this day and age. He's humorous and smart and isn't just giving his opinion - it's actually backed up by a lot of good citing and science. The last 25% loses steam and is largely irrelevant in my opinion. Maybe not for others. I liked it, I was encouraged by it, and it has helped me refocus my energy.</review-text>

		<review-text>Updated Review - July 8, 2017

Originally, I didn't give an F about this book and it wasn’t because of the usage of adult language. I'm cool with potty mouths, especially since I have one myself, so for you sensitive folks, don’t knock it just because of the title. And the language goes to PG-13 after the first couple of chapters, so quit crying and giving an F about the language. Anyway, after punching myself in the face and almost selling the book after only reading 2 chapters of it, I sat the F down and gave it a shot over a week long session while mulling over what I truly give an F about. After all, as I mentioned below, Manson’s got a great blog so I thought that there had to be some useful nuggets within. Indeed, I found a bunch. Though I was initially confused as to who is giving an F and who wasn’t, and whether the F bomb in a given sentence was a verb, noun, adjective, adverb, etc., I got over myself and opened my mind. Simply by me giving an F to what I truly value (learning, improving), I found this book to be utterly liberating. And that’s the message that Manson is conveying. Give an F to what you truly value. Don’t give an F to meaningless F---Facebook posts, to wayward values, nor to what other people think. Especially since they are just as insecure as you are.
So, get over yourself and your fear of the F word and quit crying that it’s nothing new because, it is. It’s a slap to the face of most of the feel-good, coddling self-help books that have been out on the market for the last 3 decades. It will show you that you don’t need to be coddled and suffocated with annoying positivity. What you need, and what I needed, is good ole fashioned pain and suffering if you want to get anywhere in life. After all, that’s why you’re reading a self-help book, now isn’t it?
Lastly, for those of you who read self-help books, you can’t just read it in one sitting and have any expectation of transformation or improvement. The mind does not work that way. Look up that fact. Read a chapter, apply the ideas to your life, check back, do it again. Then again. And yes, again! That’s called active learning. That’s how improvement comes. Not by simply reading a book and expecting a magic panda to come along out of the bamboo forest and erase your problems. Got it? Great, now get the F to reading this book.

Original Review:

Funny how Amazon kicked back my initial review because I used a word contained in the title of the book itself! Oh well, I don't give a f---. Here's the review with the censorship bug turned on:

Catchy title and definitely a great philosophy - to not give a f--- that is. However, the title misleads because all that you really need to know about this art is that it's not as subtle as Mark Manson claims it is (though I greatly respect his writing in his blog). For the art to be successful, one must explicitly make clear to all those around him or her that there is no doubt that there are zero f---s given in this or that particular situation. And thus, for this book, I really didn't give a f--- about it because it's all over the place, making it difficult to know who is giving a f---, who is supposed to be giving a f--- and who isn't.</review-text>

		<review-text>Mark has done it again! Forgive any bias that I have because I am a fan of his work. I pre-order this book because I had high expectations. These expectations were delivered on completely. Minus a tad bit excessive profanity, I truly enjoyed this book. I believe this book has something for everyone. For me it was the last chapter, I feel I am better able to hone in on what is truly important in life. I just think of it in the context of a cliff at the edge of the world, if I slipped would this be important. For me this was a revelation but when I offered advice through this lense to a friend he complained about me being black and white and the world doesn't work this way. That's why people need to read this book because maybe to you seeing your problems through a clif lense IS too black and white. We are all different people, some things may hit you where you need it and others you may not agree upon. But this book is filled with advice and strategies for dealing with life based in significant psychological research I think just for the sake of learning about how people's brains (yours included) this book warrants its cost. Looking forward to the next book!</review-text>

		<review-text>This book was fantastic and very real. It breaks down all those things we ball up and cling to inside, things that are unproductive and/or destructive and helps illuminate why we do them, and how to question ourselves to be better and think differently. This was super well written and really helped to hold a mirror for which we should all take a look at ourselves in and question why we do what we do and what we truly value. For anyone who is open to questioning themselves, questioning life and interested in trying to really live more fully - I think this will be a great read! I think everyone needs to read it.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book takes everything I've learned in the last ten years of my life and condensed it into a very short, very enjoyable read. There is some seriously powerful stuff in this book (such as taking 100% responsibility for everything in your life and being willing to stare in the face of your own death).

He takes the typical &quot;feel good&quot; self help structure and turns it on its end. And in its place, he gives you the solid, no frills, straight up truth. It's both a kick in the butt and a powerful reminder that we are in control of our lives. Definitely give this one a read, especially if you're new to personal development.</review-text>

		<review-text>After the initial few f-bombs and irreverent intro, it becomes a common sense self-help book and not particularly insightful. If you have had any thoughtful examination of your own life, or therapy, or read any self help books, this is kind of a waste of time. Bought it as an audio book and a hardcover. Gave away hard copy as a gift and listened to it while walking. Entertaining for a background listen. Glad I did not try to sit and read it.</review-text>

		<review-text>Well, this book certainly challenges some of my beliefs. But that's why I read it. There's great wisdom to be gained in looking at the things we currently hold as wrong or incorrect or simply out of our mental grasp, while going within to meditate or ponder on them, just to see if we can see things maybe slightly different.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is quite literally the best book I've read since 2013 when I read SO GOOD THEY CAN'T IGNORE YOU by Cal Newport. I was initially skeptical in picking the book up because I thought, based on the title, the book would just get the point across that you shouldn't care about other people's opinions, etc. But it doesn't really follow that thread at all. Pick it up.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is very entertaining. I read it in about 4 hours. I just couldn't put it down. It isn't life changing or anything but it can open up your mind to different ways of thinking.</review-text>

	<review id="1185">
		<review-text>The book's first impression (and first chapter) felt like it caters to a bit different audience.

I don't mind profanities, I use them often, but I don't revel in them. Which is why the first chapter felt a tad off putting — like written for a class full of teen rebels.

But I gotta admit, the whole book is thought provoking, decently written, and essentially well put together rehash of many useful philosophies (buddhism, stoicism, etc). And in the end, a celebration of life.

I would recommend it (especially) for people looking at a map thinking where to go next. The perspective might make your journey more interesting. And that's regardless if you are sixteen or sixty.</review-text>

		<review-text>I have been reading Marks blogs for awhile now and he is &quot;the self help guy&quot; after my own heart. It is such a practical and effective way to take a look at s*** and he is profoundly witty too!

		<review-text>Really insightful book. I've been a fan of Mark's writing ever since I came across his website earlier this year. The book feels like a tough love father-to-son talk about life and what it takes to live survive it. Many of the topics Mark talks about are enlightening and have provided me with multiple paradigm shifts. The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*** is really eye-opening and I'm definitely going to read it again. I hope this guy puts out even more books - I enjoy the way he thinks.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book really opens your eyes to how you've been living your life and helps you getting started on changing it. Mark shows that many of us have been living in some sort of entitlement in the modern world because of the need to feel great. Mark says that it's okay to be who you are. We are all going to die eventually, so are you going to live a life full of regrets? Or are you going to face your fears and do what you've always wanted to do?</review-text>

		<review-text>Mark Manson's book is probably one of the best self improvement books out there today. It is one of those books that is truly impacting my life in meaningful way. It makes me comfortable with being uncomfortable and realize that life is not all sunshine and rainbows. You choose what struggles are going to be in your life and you may not be able to predict which ones will make you happy. The pleasure in life comes from finding what struggles you enjoy and pursue those. It made me realize what is truly important to me and my life.

This book caused me to analyze my life in a tough practical manner. I now question everything about myself and realize that my emotions may not dictate what is actually occurring. I have rid my life of some of the most common distractions out there, including porn, and cleaned up my diet. I have an easier time deciding what is truly important to me.

I am more often wrong than right and I am really not all that special of a person. That may sound harsh, but it is the truth. I think it is liberating to understand this and gives the freedom to live life how you truly want to live it. Not many self improvement books will tell you that and do it in a way that make you feel great about that fact.

Manson's title may be a bit vulgar (which is what drew me to it in the first place), but I think it is what people need to hear. I highly recommend picking up a copy and reading for yourself. It is a quick read but packs a punch in delightful jokingly serious manner</review-text>

		<review-text>I read 54 books in 2016 and this perhaps was my favorite. Funny and straight-forward with amazing life lessons, the author's general message is simple: Stop comparing yourself to other people. What are the standards you have for yourself? Who do you want to be isolated from everyone else and why? Chasing dreams of others will never truly make you happy and will be a never-ending feedback loop. Stop caring so much about what other people think about you and care more about what you think of yourself. Highly recommended for anyone.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is a paradigm shifting book, that is perfect to shake the usual self help crowd out of its coma.

This book has many new idea. It's most powerful message is that life will involve some pain, and that we shouldn't deny it or be victimized by it, but instead solve the source of pain. And that is what makes us happy.

I read too many books in this genre, and this is the first in a while that I couldn't put down.</review-text>

I detest self-help books. This isn't that. If you're open to it, it gives you a road map to what you may need to work on internally. Taking notes. Big time.

		<review-text>Mark Manson writes well, and this book doesn't disappoint. My kindle is highlighted all over the chapters. The first chapter is a little weak, but the meat comes 20 percent into the book and all the way to the end. I'm forced to think about redefining the way I understand my values.

Even greater is that I'm forced to overcome issues with rejection and failure. It's hard but within this book, I realized why it's hard and that's because your identity is threatened. The last chapter on confronting death is a powerful one as well.

I'd recommend the book as it had new nuggets for me to take away and internalize. Great job Mark Manson!</review-text>

		<review-text>So to preface this I just went through a sort of existential crisis, some of the worst depression of my life. I've finished college but have just been drifting, friends are moving on with life, starting families, having kids, moving away. Romances faded, all are now married and moving on as well. Basically I was left with nothing and nobody, and when you sort of defined yourself by your relationships then your life as you know it is actually sort of over. That doesn't have to be a bad thing though.

This book has comeplely changed the way I look at pain, at responsibility, and at how I define myself and my life. Usually that would sound like I'm full of crap but here me out. I started reading this a few days ago as I started on a trip to see an ex if mine, we had been talking again and it was a 50/50 chance of any future there, but I felt I needed to do some due diligence at least. So I'm on this trip and completely at ease in a situation that would have otherwise been a bit anxiety inducing. I wasn't worried about impressing her, or even about shaping the outcome, I just knew that I was there to find the truth and was happy with that. Things went great at first but didn't work out. I walked away with dignity, and because of that actually quite happy and pleased with myself. Because I recognized where I had a choice and where I didn't, that my value wasn't determined by this girl who was torn in what she wanted but rather in how I felt I was handling things. I don't know if I can emphasize enough how empowering that feels.

I'm excited about the future for the first time in a long time. To the author thank you, it's made a world of difference, and it's only been a few days.

Tldr; got rejected, but because of this book it was a personal victory instead of something that felt like an attack</review-text>

		<review-text>I'm not a big fan of self-help books. The last time I read a self-help book that was helpful with several decades ago. Tony Robbins. I didn't think his books would be helpful either, but they really were. And now, decades later, I picked up this book only because I thought the title was funny. But, inside, isn't very clear discussion, a very clear explanation, of the types of toxic thinking that we engage in as individuals. And, better, there's a very clear roadmap presented in an easy-to-understand way, showing us how to jettison some of that thinking.

As the title suggests, there is quite a bit of swearing in this book. But it neither masks ineffective noise, nor does it detract from the message. In a strange way, it fits. And the book moves along, at a very good pace, and encourages you as you read it to go through your own process of examining yourself and figuring out what really needs to change.

I wish I could do a better job of explaining this review, all I can say is, for me, this was a very good book, and I'm very glad I picked it up. Well recommended to everyone, whether you're feeling negative or not.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is not about telling you how to live life and improve yourself. It is more about enlightenment and helping you become aware. It will not teach you a skill you don't know or a secret formula for a perfect life, but it will show you the flaws in certain thought processes.</review-text>

		<review-text>Unfortunately, within two chapters, I knew I wouldn't like this book. I gave it another two chapters more before it officially became the first book I've ever bothered to ship back to Amazon.

First, don't assume that my skin is just too thin. I learned an extensively vulgar vocabulary after six years in the Army and 10 years of traveling the world. But this book made me roll my eyes more than smile. Mark's writing is good, as it is on his blog, but the overuse of F-bombs (and generally overdone language) made me realize midstream that I was taking life advice from a 33-year-old &quot;bro&quot; with a degree in finance. I could no longer take it seriously at some point. I anticipated, given the title, that a lot of F-bombs were in order. But in this instance, the language grows wearisome, childish, and distracting.

I will still read other things Mark writes. He certainly knows how to build a successful blog. But personally, I'll stick to more mature sources for self development and life growth.</review-text>

		<review-text>This was a really good book, one I'll likely read from time to time in the future. There's nothing earth shattering here, and there's not meant to be. It's a quiet, entertaining and somewhat irreverent uncommon sense look at how we all try to cover everything, and really we just need to let a lot of thing fall by thereabouts and focus on what's really important. That's the gist, but the book goes into good detail breaking things down and spelling it out.
I've already recommended this to most of my friends. I'm really glad I bought it for myself.</review-text>

		<review-text>It took me a few sittings to finish, but it was an easy read. The ideas sound rather counterintuitive first. There are certainly a lot of entitlement mentality to go around these days. While a lot of examples are hinted at the genY, the philosophy is broadly useful for all ages. I truly hope the ideas in this book can help a few more of us to get more serious s*** done</review-text>

		<review-text>Being a Mark Manson fan for a few years now, I recognized parts of the book as being reiterated from the blog, but nonetheless it’s a great book.
If you expect advice on how to become an indifferent and insensitive person who feels good about themselves no matter what, prepare to be disappointed. The book is essentially the opposite - a wake-up call to be honest with yourself and live in accordance with healthy core values.
In today’s age of social media when we are constantly exposed to extremes and fake personas, we tend to forget our self-worth and pursue shallow ambitions in order to feel special in some way, we feel entitled to receive special treatment and get easily offended. In this sense, the book is a much needed slap in the face for the current social context.
Mark Manson offers practical advice to deal with life’s adversity in a way that few do anymore : by stating uncomfortable truths. He supports his philosophy with a neat mix of scientific studies and personal experience, not being afraid to show his own vulnerability, which is a rare thing nowadays.
I think if more of us would actually internalize these ideas and live by them, the world might just become a better place.</review-text>

Highly recommend for every human, especially those interested in personal growth, self awareness, or those struggling with any kind of emotional/creative/interpersonal/professional roadblock (ie, you). One of those people whose words provide new and profound meaning every time you revisit them. He's smart, he's blunt, and he's quite funny.

To sum up the 5 chapters I could stomach listening to; Life isn't fair so suck it up buttercup, no one gets to be happy but these things make you happy, some stories about failures who failed and some who succeeded yet were never happy, yadda, yadda, yadda. Zero f***s rating. I had hope for funny ways of looking at personal development and instead it's just a snarky douche bag airing his feelings and getting paid to do so.

		<review-text>I like the title of this book first of all . I would say that this is a book everyone needs to read. I agree with Mark that the self-help, life coach gurus are pretty meaningless esp if they've never lived. And that's what this book is about. How to live and face your own mortality and that we have a limited time on Earth. I like that Mark gets down to the substance of how we are to deal with our own broken and messed up lives and how best to bring change in that. I love his whole thing on motivation... even if you are not motivated at first it's better to do something even if you don't feel like it to meet your goals. A great book for anyone going through life's trials or regular folks that just need some guidance and advice for regular day living.</review-text>

		<review-text>Seriously... stop giving a F#*$ what people think &amp; start creating.

That's the big message &amp; takeaway from this. Be you, live your authentic self, &amp; share you voice with the world that the universe intended it to be.

Then when you do that, you'll attract the audience that you were meant to lead.

Mark's funny antics, stories, &amp; lessons are something that will leave you entertained, inspired, &amp; fired up to go give your own version of the middle finger to the world around you. I mean that in a good way too. ;)

Go grab a copy &amp; be sure to show it some love by leaving it an honest review too. If you hate it, be sure to tell Mark as I'm sure he'll appreciate the irony here...

		<review-text>Books should be good. Not all great books should be written by scholars, professors, doctors or gurus.

I bought this book for my 21 year old son stationed in Japan. When it came I decided to read it and I'm glad I did. I then thought it would also suit my 15 year old son as it fits him more closely than the older one though both will no doubt get some great insight from this book.

The information in here are the exact things I have thought myself- to be positive without being overly positive. To learn from your experiences and to learn what's most important to care about in life and let the rest fall away. Not giving an F about stupid stuff like how you appear to others that don't really matter, stop carrying around your parents baggage and to know when to move on. This subtle art is something we all need to relearn and will do a great justice for humanity if we did. I have never heard of this aurthor before but I'll certainly be looking up his futur works.

He gives great examples, quotes, studies etc. to make already valid, common sense points. It's easy and fun to read and I recommend every 15-60 year old read it. If you are someone who wants to understand the law of attraction, how a negative can be a positive get this book. You won't be able to put it down.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is a great book. I am a fan of something different than the regular self help book. Those that are written by non experts in a very unorthodox way. For me this book helps me a lot. Just read it and don't give a f'#*&quot;'~</review-text>

		<review-text>I used to think I was the type of person who did not give a f*** about things that weren't important. When I saw this book I thought I could learn some new ways to up my game. Boy, did I learn a lot about myself. I am an amateur at the sport. I worry about way too many things I have no control over. Reading this book is like sitting down with a good friend and he spills it out for you. This book is all meat and potatoes. There are some parts where he seems to ramble off subject, but it is still worth the read.</review-text>

		<review-text>I've followed Mark Manson for a few years and love everything he writes. This book is no exception to that. Mark boils a &quot;happy&quot; life down to the values we are willing to suffer for, not positivity or a sense of entitlement about being &quot;happy.&quot; Manson correctly diagnosis's us as creatures in a perpetual state of suffering and pain, not beings that can obtain a state known as happiness.

Throughout the book Manson balances humor, tough love, and grounded insight to create the best &quot;non-self help&quot; book I've encountered.

Please read if you have trouble being happy, feel entitled to happiness, are terrible at boundaries in your relationship, or most importantly like the F word.</review-text>

		<review-text>Are you ready for this book? I wasn't ready for it even three months ago. And three months before that. And all the time before that. This book needs the reader to be in a place where they are ready to accept the concepts - already letting go of some of the ego, some of the entitlement, and a lot of pride. I am lucky that it came out when it did, and that it was the right time for me to read it, and from now on it will be, I hope, the right time for me to re-read it and apply it, every day, every moment I make a choice to take responsibility for what happens to me and for what I do.

There is nothing new here - and yet there is SO MUCH NEW here. What spoke to me was the way Mark uses new words and new combinations of words to talk about the concepts we've heard from old sayings, philosophy, and basically everything your grandmother ever taught you. A cliche, no matter how essentially true, may lose its meaning after the n-th time you've heard it. Saying the same stuff in a different way made me look at the life lessons here differently, and resulted in the most a-ha moments of any book I read recently.

They key concept of the book for me was the new and very broad application of what it means to be ENTITLED. Mark broadens the definition, including some of the things I viewed completely differently before, and then slams it home (with very colorful use of the f word throughout) so that it hurts and that it sticks.

I began applying the concepts from this book as I read it. It's been less than a week, and I can already see the difference in my life, my family, my work, and my own peace of mind. No, not happiness - peace of mind. I am surprised that such a young person can have so much to say, and I'm humbled by the realization of where I am and where I was. I hope I walk away changed forever - and I know it's not painless, and that it requires work, and that work never stops, and that it's worth it.

Thank you, Mark.</review-text>

		<review-text>If you've been reading or taking endless self help programs and wondering why your progress seems to have slowed or stalled, this book may have the answer. Personal improvement programs, no matter how good, often only give us a temporary high. It strokes our ego, makes us think we're special for having found and obtained some special knowledge. This can ultimately lead to a sense of entitlement: &quot;I know these things that others don't, I must be special, I will be destined for great things!&quot; This book made me realize that having these thoughts are actually counter productive! It is human nature to seek temporary highs, whether from self help advice or something more damaging like meaningless sex, drugs, or alchohol to satisfy our hunger, our insecurities. This book is a wake up call. It's the missing piece in the self help puzzle that can break you out of the thoughts and values that you didn't even realize were holding you back.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book was... not for me. It was, at best, a first grader primer when I was looking for something a little meatier.

I read it all the way through (it had been recced to me, and I wanted to give it a fair shake), but never shook the impression that it was facile and shallow. (Which, I suppose I could have gathered from the title, but I was literally trying not to judge a book by its cover.)

I'm honestly not sure if the author is a slick huckster selling a couple hundred pages of shopworn &quot;observations,&quot; or if he's just young and this is as far as he's gotten. I suppose for a similarly young and inexperienced reader, this book might be helpful, so I don't want to knock it too hard, but if you've spent any time at all reading and thinking about mindful living, this little book is of no value. Sorry. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</review-text>

		<review-text>This book will add years to your life. If your future old and wise self could travel back in time to give advice to the present you on how to live a more fulfilling life, your future self would likely tell you about the very same concepts discussed in The Subtle Art of Not Giving a ___. Mark Manson just did us the huge favor of packaging these concepts into an enthralling 200 page read with a playful orange cover so that we don’t have to wait until we are 80 years old to say, “Yep, wish I figured this out sooner…”
When I say this book will add years to your life what I mean is that it will encourage you to stop wasting time on empty pursuits, false beliefs and self-imposed limitations and will instead teach you how to focus on what really matters. This is what Mark refers to as being selective about the **cks we give and living life in line with the core values that we choose to hold dear, rather than those imposed on us by external sources (i.e., society, our peers, social media, etc.). To accomplish this Mark draws on the findings of history’s various thinkers as well as his own personal life experiences and observations in order to “tell it like it is”, whether we like to hear it or not.
Don’t get me wrong, the art of cutting out distractions and focusing on what really matters to each individual person takes many years to master, if not a lifetime. Those looking for a quick fix 6 minute abs type of solution probably won’t get much out of this book. Neither will people who are stubbornly set in their ways. This book is for those who are serious about cutting out the bull, asking themselves the hard questions and examining their identity from a fresh perspective.
Some of us are already far along on the never ending path of personal growth. Others are just getting started. No matter where you are I believe this book is worth reading. I would not be surprised if 20-50 years from now Mark Manson is considered to be one of the defining authors and thinkers of our generation.</review-text>

		<review-text>Do you remember that kid in junior high who tried SO HARD to be cool? His mom bought him cool shoes and cool jeans and a cool jacket -- and it felt like an awkward kid was just trying too hard. He somehow missed the target even though he had all the right stuff. This book reminded me of that kid.

There are some good ideas here. There is original thought and cleverness. But there is an awful lot of awkward posturing. Everytime Mark drops the f-bomb it reminds me of that kid again. The kid who thinks if he cusses and spits and smokes he will be able to hang out with the cool kids. Unfortunately many of those cool kids will sense that he is actually really needy and insecure. They sense his inauthenticity.

I am not one of the cool kids, but I found the inauthenticity and profanity grating. Instead of confidence, I felt bluster. I would not want to be stuck on plane with Mark, and would not spend money to hear him speak. I can't justify spending my money for a couple of hours of reading on this.</review-text>

		<review-text>I loved this book. Mark Manson's candid discourse about serious topics and hard to swallow truths is beautifully made lighthearted with the undertone of the tough love an older brother. Manson's nonchalant use of profanity and cockyfunny toilet humor enable him to do this well. Furthermore, this book takes a very different approach to self-help than other books. Rather than focusing on how to make more money, daye more women, etc., Mark Manson directs the reader towards being content with having less. He also focuses on the number one thing that probibit the reader from obtaining all of the things he/she wants from life: avoidance. If you want to know more, you will have to buy the book.</review-text>

		<review-text>Regurgitated pieces of knowledge from other sources, but mixed in with a lot of unnecessary negative words and crude attitude. If one truly didn't give a f*, they wouldn't have tried so hard on seeming &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;collected&quot;. If anything, I felt that this was hard to listen to even though I use f* as an adjective and a noun quite often. This felt more like an aimless rant than a useful guide.

		<review-text>My friend gave me the audiobook version, hence why this isn't a verified purchase. I'm writing this review in hope that you would not waste your time like I have. This book sounds like a frat boy's version of zen for beginners. I use profanity myself, and have never had an issue in my life hearing the f-word, but the author abuses the f-word like he was trying to overcompensate for not being cool in school or something. And then there's all that talk about bedding women, and all these places he's seen. There's sharing, and then there's boasting.

I was feeling comfortable, loving, and inspired, but after reading this book, found myself irritated and annoyed at the world, and all its inhabitants. Terrible society, why should I give a f*** about them! Me, me, me! Yes, I believe in self-love and self-acceptance. I believe the world will be a better place when you are truthful to who you are and prioritize what you truly care about. But do you really want to learn that lesson with a book so crude and distasteful? Have some respect for yourself. You deserve better than this trashy &quot;bestseller&quot; written by an author who doesn't actually give a f*** about you either.</review-text>

		<review-text>I won't repeat the title of the book since the vulgarity confuses Amazon although they have no problem selling it.. I don't mind the words, but they go on and on with no real point. This is a guy who is basically bragging about his sex life and his alleged enlightenment, but he never gets to the point. His grasp of psychology is pretty thin ( a few months of Psychology Today). His humility is non existent. He's sanctimonious and meandering in his writing. He's basically taken a blog and stretched it for 200 pages. The basic point is figure out what matters in your life and go for it and if you're doing other things that distract you from that, stop doing those things. He's also exceptionally judgmental about choices other folks make that might not align with his values. Not worth the read. PS - Amazon.....when folks use the title of his book it's not vulgarity.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is one for the intellectually honest individuals. Mark offers tremendous insights into the paradox of the different paradigms in which most self help addresses, but he focuses on the notion of seeing the world as it is and not so much about seeing the world in a way you'd like to see it. Yes the world is a beautiful place, but it also has its guts and horrors and if you choose to not accept that about life, it is only a matter of time until your throat will be slit. (Not literally.) But ultimately this book is a different approach to self help that I myself have fallen trap to in some areas, but it is one of those books that shows you the blind spots that you cannot see when you are so focused on attaining a certain goal of &quot;success.&quot;</review-text>

		<review-text>While it sounds like an obvious gimmick (dropping an F-bomb in the title of a self-help book in order to show how &quot;edgy&quot; it is) Mark Manson's &quot;The Subtle Art...&quot; is a very well-written, deeply thought-out take on the perils of modern living. We can only care about so much, Manson posits, and most of us tend to waste that limited reservoir of &quot;giving a f---&quot; on the trivial, mundane, and shallow. How much better, then, would our lives be if we reserved that energy and focus for the things that truly matter?

Exactly how to achieve that focus forms the core of this book, and Manson offers several strategies to help you integrate that aim into your own life. As with all such books, the precise mechanics are left to the reader, but the principles here are sound and workable. It's difficult to escape the conclusion that the author is right: in a world where people care about such trivia as the winner of a TV show or the latest celebrity gossip, many of us need to adjust our priorities and ask ourselves just what, exactly, is worth caring about. This book is a great place to start. Highly recommended.</review-text>

		<review-text>Not a great book about how to go about self improvement. The chapter about why russians are better than americans at figuring out who to trust and who not is kind of a masterpiece in generalization and attempts at interpreting history. Basically russians are more trustworthy because they are not caught up in trying to be nice to please like americans. Why? Because they have had to distrust for so many years with KGB coopting their families and neighbors into ratting on them... I don't know if I buy this. Well. It was good reading. Just not really self improvement. I think Mark Manson should have titled this: How I grew up from college party boy/playboy to serious man with a dose of common sense in me.</review-text>

The book opens with a discussion of Bukowski, who Manson appears to be praising amid calling him a &quot;loser.&quot; After reading a bit more, suffice to say that, at least with respect to quality of prose, Manson isn't fit to carry Bukowski's jock.

So the guy on the back flap with perfect whitened teeth and fashionable haircut is the guy who's telling us not a to give a f---? The whole thing just reeks of phony Tai Lopez style hucksterism. For a guy who touts a mantra of &quot;don't try,&quot; he seems to be trying awfully hard.</review-text>

		<review-text>I started out with the audio book, and honestly I had just downloaded it because I thought it would be something interesting to listen to during a long car ride. We didn't listen to it on the trip, but shortly thereafter I was getting treatment for depression and anxiety again. Listening to this book was one of the things that helped me the most with my anxiety, to the point that I wanted the hard copy so I could read specific parts when I needed to, or make notes about something without having to listen to a whole section again. There is a certain relief in the straight forward way that Mark Manson points out the flaws in the self esteem movement, and the lessons that suffering is not a negative experience, but the values you choose make the experiences easier or more difficult on yourself. When my anxiety would get so high that I couldn't focus on anything else I would just start chapter one and listen to his description of the feedback loop from h*ll which would help me work my wait out of it. When I would start to feel hopeless or frustrated or angry or whatever emotion I was dealing with seemed to have a corresponding chapter with it that would help me refocus what I was experiencing, and eventually rethink everything. I have never been one to read self help books but have always been interested in the human psyche and this book was so insightful to myself as well as the people around me that it didn't really seem like a self help book. &quot;The solution lies in the acceptance and active engagement of that negative experience, not the avoidance of it, not the salvation of it.&quot;</review-text>

		<review-text>The book is clever no doubt. But I have a few problems with it.

First, after doing some more research on the author, reading his other materials and stuff written about him, and just generally consuming his content, I sense that Manson is just making a career out of being that person who's contrarian just for the sake of it. He has this very sarcastic view on life. Yes, some people might need that wake up call, but I'm pretty sure that most truly successful people don't think that way.

Second, and this might be a bit trite, but I don't trust authors who have to resort to using profanity to get their point across. I understand the use of language in movies and TV and such in order to increase dramatic effect. But in terms of a self-help book...I don't see the use. Reading his book, although interesting, was actually somewhat annoying because of how frequently he uses satirical, foul language to get his point across. This is neither professional or necessary.

I might be one of those self-entitled losers (according to Manson) who gets easily offended by books like this...but I'm not. I've read other contrarian advice books about business and life that didn't use sarcastic, foul, cynical language to get their points across. I honestly felt depressed after reading his book - not encouraged and certainly not convicted to change. Just depressed. I suggest reading the book, only if you want to see how low some people will go to 'gain attention' for their self-help methods.

I suggest that you read books by people who have actually accomplished things in life, apart from their own blogs and marketing schemes. Read books by people who have built enterprises and changed the world. It's okay read books by 'thinkers' whose main job is to &quot;think about and analyze (and blog)&quot; about the world around them...but be careful.</review-text>

It is not so much about letting go of what you think others think (e.g. to help a &quot;people pleaser&quot; not to care so much) as it is an overall philosophy of life. He makes an argument for turning many adages on their heads. If you want to learn to ignore your mean-spirited co-worker, this is not the book for you. If you want to blaze a new trail and shake up your life, this book aims to help you do just that.</review-text>

		<review-text>There are 2-3 interesting points I got from this book in total, but otherwise, the writing is quite shallow. The long intro story in each chapter does not necessarily support the point that the author tries to make afterward. Many of the stories he told are purposely over exaggerated at the superficial level just to make them sound more interesting (looking back at the title, yup, this is his favorite writing style). According to his anecdote, as a blogger, he didn't give a F* about the accuracy of what he writes (coolness is what he gives a F* about, not accuracy). He said he has grown, but looking at this book, he hasn't quite gotten over that irresponsible writing habit yet.

In addition, the author's life story is so annoying. He tells us how he was a privilege spoiled kid who ruined his own life with his irresponsibilities and self obsession. Then he talks about how he got over his spoiled behavior and habits. Ugh, I had to stop reading at the part where he whines about his past relationship problem for the third time. I feel this book is more suitable for younger readers. I feel that the author has yet to face the real challenges in life. His writing style makes it obvious that he has not grown over that self-obsession stage. In an early chapter, he claims that this book is completely different from the other self-help books, and that other self-help books are basically useless. Yet, in depth, lots of ideas presented in this book have already been written about in various many other books.</review-text>

I found myself drifting away from whatever the message was supposed to be (maybe I got sidetracked by the author's repeated examples of how many girls he has slept with).

		<review-text>There are some interesting anecdotes and observations here, such as the story about the Japanese soldier who waged WWII on a Phillipine island 30 years after the war ended. And it starts off well enough.

Soon after the promising opening chapters, however, Manson descends into sanctimony and condescension. He is particularly (and insultingly) dismissive of mental health conditions like depression or schizophrenia. If you've been diagnosed with, or think you suffer from, moderate or severe depression, this book is probably not for you. It could prompt you to feel worse about yourself. The author has no clue about how difficult it is to &quot;pull yourself up&quot; while in the throes of a nightmarish condition like major depression.

Manson also &quot;peoples&quot; far too much. By this I mean he lazily goes on about how &quot;people do x&quot; or &quot;people think y,&quot; as though everyone but himself engages in these practices he sneers at. Since Manson rarely provides any evidence, these are strawman arguments, as far as I'm concerned. Just as bad is his obsession with &quot;entitlement.&quot; He sounds a bit like an old man yelling at clouds. It seems every other paragraph includes a rant worthy of a right-wing talk show host about how entitled we entitled readers are to our entitlements. He may as well include the entire planet in his diatribes.

At the same time he excoriates greed and materialism, it looks like Manson's pandering to young alphas so that he can make a buck. Still, this book made me curious enough to check out his blog, so I guess I got hoodwinked as much as other &quot;people&quot; did.</review-text>

		<review-text>In many ways, this is a book about Buddhism (Life is suffering.), with some Taoism (Life is incomprehensible.) thrown in. I think of it as, “Life is one big dichotomy,” but the general theme is that we care about too many things that don’t really matter. And we do it because we see things through the single perspective of feelings like pleasure, anger, superiority, etc., all of which are fleeting (impermanent in the vernacular of Buddhism) and hollow (i.e. illusory or myopic).

You can’t have it all – as in you can’t embrace all values. You need to choose. And you need to choose wisely. We need better values, and those are the ones that face inward, that speak to the person you really are, not the way people may perceive you.

The writing is witty, fluid, and to the point. It’s a bit of a cross between Hunter S. Thompson and a British social comic, although the Brits call it irony.

There is a fair amount of pseudo-cussing, if you will, but it’s more a call to attention than a vessel filled with meaning. Manson admits in the beginning that based on his earlier life he is an unlikely messenger of such philosophical gravitas. The language, more than anything, simply establishes the credibility of that claim and serves to enhance the power of the contrast between old self (eventful) and current self (fulfilled, or getting there).

The money line, for me, was an insight about the impact of technology. “Our lives today are filled with the information from the extremes of the bell curve of human experience…This flood of extreme information has conditioned us to believe that exceptionalism is the new normal.” If you haven’t gone viral yet, or your small business hasn’t disrupted an entire industry, you’re nobody.

That said, I hesitate to call this book exceptional, although Manson is a big fan of calling things what they are. So, yes, this is an exceptional book.</review-text>

		<review-text>I got the referral for this book from entrepreneur magazine. I decided to buy it because I could use some knowledge in the area of not giving too many &quot;effs&quot;. The author has some good ideas and relatively relatable examples but, overall, he just comes off as crude. I think that he eliminates a wider range of audience by dropping 15 F bombs per sentence. We get it! You're cool and don't care because you use the F word in a book! I can look past that, it's not a big deal, but honestly his lax writing style loses him credibility. He went from informed and experienced author at the beginning of the book to joe shmoe who gets his 15 minutes of fame for having the F word in the title of a book. Edgy....but that doesn't make him an informed author.
I realize the irony in this review, being that I clearly give too many F's (haha) but I think if I would have known at the beginning of the book that he was just a guy who doesn't care about anyone or anything, I wouldn't have bought the book. So, I thought I'd offer the information to anyone else who is like me. The guy has some good ideas and thoughts but it's hard to take the advice of a guy whose audience is only targeted to be the people who already don't give an F.</review-text>

		<review-text>When a book like this stays at the top of a best-seller list, there must be something which resonates in it for many people. I read it to find out what that was.

What was the advice in here which you aren't getting elsewhere? And why does not giving a F* help you live a better life?

I realized when I was about 45 years old that sometimes people who didn't care as much as I did were somehow successful. What was the lesson in that? Mark Manson, the author, offers up some ideas on that.

I also realized that when we set our hopes on a particular outcome such as hoping to meet Mr. Wonderful on a date, that every date is usually a failure and disappointing. However, if we say to ourselves: I'm just going to go out with 50 people and figure out what I enjoy companioning with, every date is a success because the outcome you are hoping for is wisdom, or a learning experience. And you can cross one more number off of your list of people whom you went out with. My professor said I should get t-shirts with numbers on them for them.

These are some of the lessons which author Mark Manson dispenses in this book which may save you some pain. I also like his lesson on doing something even if you're unsure of a destination. I've been waiting for an ideal destination to show up in my life on what I'm supposed to be doing.
I have several directions I'd like to move in, but not sure which is right, if either of them. Mark's advice is just to do something is wise.

He also suggests that if you're not motivated, get started anyway, as the action will usually produce some kind of positive result which will be motivating. I've been putting off cleaning off the treadmill of stuff now that the weather in the northeast has turned cold. I just haven't been motivated enough. Tomorrow - whether motivated or not - am going to clear it off and plug it in and get on it. Do something.

I was reading this book and Mark mentioned that he graduated from college in 2007. Wait a minute - that's when my son graduated from college. I'm taking life advice from my son basically? I know way more about life than my son, or his friends, and could tell him a thing or two about life. Am I crazy?

Actually, I'm impressed that Mark has learned these life lessons in his early 30's which took me years to learn, and some in this book I haven't learned yet. I think the central one about not giving a flying f* is one you have to keep practicing at. Depersonalizing your situation is another. Mark makes the point that our problems aren't that original. So, why take things so personally?

Mark also writes about what if we're wrong about something we hold dear? Maybe we should consider that possibility. I read an interview with Ray Dalio on his new book Principles and he brought that point up. That's something to consider more deeply. That maybe the opposite of what we think is actually true. I recall I used to think it a sign of weakness to drop a class when I was in college. Now that my kids have been in college, I'd tell them, if you're not enjoying a class or a professor, and it's not a requirement, drop it. Life is too short to waste time with someone whose teaching doesn't inspire you, as there are others out there who will. So, the opposite of what I thought back then I realize is now true. Not sure why it took 30 years to figure that out, but if I'd used Mark and Ray's method of considering the opposite of my opinion, logic might have told me that. I think back to a few great profs I had, and wish I'd taken MORE classes from them instead of wasting time on other teachers. It makes you wonder what delusions you are operating under now. Will have to consider that more deeply.

I found it fascinating Mark's experience in Russia where people don't sugar coat stuff. And how bracingly, refreshing that is. I recall Martha Beck saying she decided to tell the truth for a year, and her life blew up, but she got a better life more congruent with her values. It has been tempting to try that for awhile.

So, takeaways from this book are to not care as much about stuff about what people think as in trying to please folks all of the time, do something on the projects which tantalize even if not sure where they may lead, just clean off the treadmill and get on it even if not motivated to start new winter exercise program, tell the truth more, keep reminding yourself to count success in learning experiences not their outcome. And learn how to analyze an opposing point of view, just in case your opinion might be wrong.

This book was fun to read, and made me laugh. I might read it again as some of the lessons need reinforcement.</review-text>

		<review-text>Honestly, many people already understand the concept of this book, age old wisdoms of don't care what others think of you, be honest, learn to say no, blah, blah, blah. Using the eff word in the title is a gimmick meant to get your attention.

I'm aware that many people use social media mainly as a bragging platform, never revealing the crappy stuff in their lives. It is a fascade. But I see the crappy stuff in others' lives, even when they don't discuss it, because I have that kind of insight that comes from being around awhile. Because I'm in my 50s with lots of life experience, I easily see through the superficial. So for me, this book doesn't reveal anything new. I'm not living my life in order to brag about it on social media. And, I have a lot of friends who don't even use social media. Lots of people walking around are living full lives without it being splashed on some internet pages.

Also, I found the repeated use of the eff word in the book to be an assault to my senses and could not read too far because of it. I went into reading it with an open mind, but it came across as someone who doesn't have a vocabulary big enough to explain the many nuanced feelings people have. &quot;Use your words, Mark.&quot;</review-text>

I have read and listened to teachers of all disciplines on personal development, introspection, etc. I was hoping this would be a great combination of insight and dogma. It really felt like I was going to lose my sanity listening to this but wanted to give the whole thing a chance.

I only chose this book because it came highly recommended. I did not like the title. I also didn't care for the first chapter, that used the word I cannot write so often that the text became almost meaningless. However I made myself continue reading as I'd already invested money in the hardcover edition.

Once I got into the second chapter, the book became much better. The premise is that most of our life is pretty ordinary, yet we are comparing ourselves to people's online presence, celebrities and prodigies. This causes us to feel bad about ourselves and seek solutions , often in the form of buying things or addictions. The author recommends taking responsibility for our life and accepting that we will never be problem-free. He also recommends accepting that life is a journey and that we never reach the point of being &quot;Done.&quot; (At least not until we die, which is the subject of the last chapter.)

I thought that Chapters 2 through 8 were well-written and insightful. Topics include happiness, suffering, making choices, and accepting that failing is part of success. Overall I think this book would be beneficial for people who are trying to make changes in their life (or business) and are finding that the &quot;positive thinking&quot; school of thought is not working for them. The book would not be enjoyed by anyone who doesn't like profanity.</review-text>

		<review-text>Bought this on the recommendation of the DailyStoic.com folks. Disappointing read - felt it was kind of a long whine. Not really aimed at me (I'm an old fart), it felt like it was written for millennial's. Loved &quot;Ego Is The Enemy&quot;, buy that instead 10x the book.</review-text>

		<review-text>First, lets address the absurdity of actually reading a &quot;self-help&quot; book, a genre that's typically an ill-begotten cross-breed between Slapstick Comedy &amp; Horror. Second, Let Us Give Thanks that this is NOTHING like Sarah Knight's utterly idiotic book with a similar title, &quot;The Life Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck.&quot; Unlike Knight's narcissistic exercise in cynical marketing, this guy is intelligent, funny, unapologetic &amp; (mostly) real.

Here's the Likes: You are going to die. Soon. You are not a magically unique snowflake. You are responsible for your own life. Even though you didn't get to choose all aspects of your life, you are still responsible for how you play the cards you were dealt. Good values lead to good choices lead to a better life. Therefore be selective about what you choose to care about and devote your time to. Accept the bitter with the sweet. (i.e, if you want the corner office, put an inflatable mattress under your desk). Feelings aren't commands. Not everyone is entitled to your Bad Mood, nor does it entitle you to behave like a hungry wombat to innocent bystanders. Relentless &quot;positive thinking&quot; is a self-delusional avoidance mechanism (often exercised best in conjunction with passive aggression). Pain is unavoidable &amp; All Wisdom comes from Suffering. I could recite his little anecdote about Buddha, or I could pedantically point out that all this is in The Iliad, but without descending into Homeric Poetry or the convoluted depths of the Eight-Fold Path, The Dread Pirate Roberts in The Princess Bride captured it best: &quot;Life is Pain, Highness. Anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to sell you something.&quot;

Okely Dokely. Since all this seems self-evident to me, I cannot say that I found it particularly &quot;enlightening,&quot; but it is SO RARE to have anyone say anything real in this culture, that the mere fact Manson is calling a spade a spade is remarkable &amp; delightful. If these truths are not self-evident to you, you should read this book &amp; reboot your brain. If for no other reason than its a lot short than the Iliad ;)

The Dings: First, it is not that easy to change your values, even if you tell yourself to in &quot;your best Yoda voice.&quot; If you happen to really, truly value education, and you can't get into a decent school, the fact that your wife makes good cookies is unlikely to help. Likewise, if you worked your butt off to land a good job &amp; you can't, that is legitimately disappointing and advice to simply &quot;change your values&quot; from gainful employment to volunteering at the homeless shelter is (IMHO) glib and facile. This portion of the book treads dangerously close to the empty-headed positive thinking that Manson claims to detest.

Second, there is still some disappointing bs in Manson's alleged &quot;values&quot; of &quot;compassion; non-violence; and honesty.&quot; While I am not advocating their opposite, these platitudes are not PERSONAL values that will help you lead a better life. &quot;Non-violence,&quot; seriously? How often is that really a decision-point for prospective readers of this book (or &quot;readers&quot; at all)? And as for &quot;honesty,&quot; while whole treatises have been written about it, it is fairly self-evident to most rational adults that there are layers of &quot;honesty,&quot; different modalities of expressing personal opinions (wherein choosing a weaker form is not necessarily &quot;dishonest&quot;) and that it is emphatically NOT always &quot;the best policy.&quot; If you seriously doubt this, try telling your mother-in-law over Easter Brunch exactly WHY you don't wear her pink macrame sweater w/embroidered angels, and that perhaps you might find her political opinions more persuasive if she didn't drop out of school at 19 to have kids. Learning what to say (&amp; what NOT to say), how to say it, when to say it, and -- MOST importantly -- WHETHER to say something at all to your boss, spouse, child, parent, sibling, etc. is one of the hallmarks of maturity. Of course this does not mean you should permanently repress all your feelings and &quot;live a lie,&quot; but &quot;Discretion is the better part of valor.&quot; Therefore, rather than making a fetish out of &quot;honesty&quot; and &quot;communication,&quot; it might be better to decide whether to stay with your spouse based on whether s/he is OVERALL a good parent, relatively tolerable, occasionally amusing, and doesn't ruin your life excessively, rather than on constant mutual psycho-analysis. You can (&amp; should) choose which &quot;truths&quot; to tell. It is NEVER a good idea to tell your husband that your ex-boyfriend was a better lover. It IS a good idea to tell him he's a great Dad. Even though both facts might be equally true. That is why you have that nifty neo-cortex, to filter out what NOT to say and do.

Even more deceptive than the honesty shtick is the common contemporary mantra that &quot;money doesn't buy happiness.&quot; I have yet to find a &quot;self-help&quot; book that &quot;honestly&quot; addresses this serious existential issue. While I am not advocating the relentless pursuit of filthy lucre, dismissing material concerns as &quot;irrelevant&quot; -- as ALL these books try to do -- is DIS-honest &amp; misleading. There is a reason why SO many people chase money, and it is NOT because all of them are stupid, superficial, or glued to the internet. It is because most people grasp that Time is Money, or more importantly, MONEY IS TIME. In my experience, the GREATEST cause of serious unhappiness (including anxiety, depression, debilitating stress, and the resulting chemical and behavioral band-aids we use to self-medicate) is that so few people have the TIME to do things they WANT to do, as opposed to things they HAVE to do. Pretending that money doesn't help bridge that gap is ridiculous. It is money, not &quot;compassion&quot; or &quot;non-violence&quot; that pays for a good house in a good neighborhood and a good education and good care for your kids and parents so you can chillax once in a while and don't have to waste years of your life changing diapers (on both ends of the life cycle) or other mindless drudgery. So while money is not the only condition independently sufficient for &quot;happiness,&quot; it IS a necessary condition, and while money may not &quot;buy&quot; happiness, for most people poverty WILL &quot;buy&quot; misery.

Caveat: If you truly think you'd be happier living in poverty in a silent Tibetan monastery, Get Thee Yonder. But I suspect that is not the target audience of this book. So if you kinda like having access to cars, airplanes, sanitation, central heating, hot running water, 24 hour groceries, pharmacies, and hospitals, but could do with less traffic, congestion, and sensory overload, be honest about what it takes to actually achieve that comfort. As the Delphic Oracle noted even before Manson, &quot;Know Yourself.&quot; In other words: &quot;Happiness is a choice. Make it. And don't cry.&quot;</review-text>

		<review-text>Out of all of the so called self help books I have read (and trust me, I've read a lot), there are only a handful that I think are truly helpful and worthwhile. This is one of those. Mark is thoughtful, sympathetic, brash and honest. There is no fluff here, neither in the writing nor the meaning. Like a laser he sees through the B.S. of the self help, psychology and other industries, as well as the B.S. of life and calls it all out by name. This forthrightness is refreshing and much needed in today's world. This book is not for those wanting a secret that they and the world are all okay. It is one that will make you seriously contemplate the deeper meanings of your loce by pulling away the veil you and everyone hides behind. Glorious and inspirational, I tip my hat to you, Mark Manson, for doing what all great thinkers do, show us the truth no matter how ugly that is. And in that truth is the light we all need to see by, and the beacon which both calls us forth and shows is the way.</review-text>

		<review-text>Sometimes fun, sometimes immature, amateurishly psychological, occasionally shallow, unfocused, self-conscious and conflicted, this book started out well enough but lost steam for me when he judged people who &quot;felt too good&quot; about themselves or were what he considered overly self-confident for no reason, which kind of describes the author himself in my opinion. Something prickled at the back of my consciousness when he made thin, amateurish case assessments of people he deemed full of themselves or clueless about whether or not they were actually successful or happy. I kept thinking, Who is he to judge? Is he an experienced therapist who has dealt extensively with narcissistic and other personality disorders? I felt these assessments to be frivolously tossed out just to substantiate any given point he was trying to make - but didn't. For me, the writer is a would-be smart-ass-turned-&quot;deep thinker&quot; with a good book title that sold an overworked editor on an otherwise confused thought process. I gave up a little after halfway through because I could see it was just going to be more of the same annoying claptrap most of us have already encountered in the millions of so-called self-help books thrown at us since high school.</review-text>

		<review-text>We have this bright orange book with an F-bomb in the title that kind of grabs your attention doesn't it? It seemed a bit &quot;gimmicky&quot; to me and perhaps that preconceived notion prevented me from truly enjoying this book. They say, &quot;don't judge a book by its cover&quot; and perhaps I'm guilty of pre-judging with this book.

I'm not sure what it was, but I felt like I was reading &quot;Don't Sweat the Small Stuff&quot; on steroids with a lot more cursing and from a less mature and less polished author.

I felt that much of the material was common-sense thinking that we've heard plenty of times before like not sweating the small stuff, pick your battles, etc. These are the things we learn as we mature, grow, and find as we battle through the adversity that life throws at us.

Now, I don't want to just bash here because I always find value in every book I read so I'll point to the interesting story of Dave Mustaine, the founder of Megadeth, who was kicked out of Metallica before they became a powerhouse rock band. This was a great anecdotal story about not comparing yourself to others.

The single best piece of value is something that continues to come up in my reading and that's about taking action. Just DO SOMETHING! Take Action! Mark points out that taking action creates an endless loop that looks like this;

Inspiration -&gt; Motivation -&gt; Action -&gt; Inspiration -&gt; Motivation -&gt; Action -&gt; and on and on.

I couldn't agree more here with our author. So many people are paralyzed with trying to perfect something and we just need to take &quot;Imperfect Action&quot; to get that forward momentum or inertia working in our favor.

This book was published in September of 2016 and it has some raving fans who felt a lot different about the book's content and value. It has a 4.6 rating on Amazon with 1,214 reviews and Goodreads gives it 4.03 stars with 30,489 ratings and 2,248 reviews. So, maybe it's just me? Maybe I was having a bad day? I'm going with 3 stars, and that's generous. Pick it up and give it a read and tell me if I'm full of crap!</review-text>

		<review-text>It's mainly rehashed, then &quot;effed-up&quot; for effect, westernized, stripped-down Buddhism--to me, not contrarian or new. The method could be explained thoroughly, and has been by others, without basing it on popularized eastern religious teachings.

This wise way of encountering life can become self-evident without referencing any religion or philosophy--just from studying in the &quot;school of hard knocks,&quot; aka living the fun and pain of everyday experiences plus reflecting then learning, moment by moment. But modernized old religion is how this author came into his insights, so, of course, he explains his findings and method in such terms.

His is certainly a valid way to find and to describe this method--with f-bombs throughout (so, for readers who hate those, better pass on this, obviously). Still, as self-help books go, I rate it better than most.</review-text>

		<review-text>While driving I listened to Mark being interviewed on one of Lewis Howes' podcasts &quot;The School of Greatness.&quot; He was authentic and very entertaining. Mark's book is more than I expected. Really digs deep with experiential examples that explains the shroud of entitlement we wear in trying to be better than others or conversely being the victim. His theme appears to be honesty and to forget about finding self. Instead, grow. Focus on value, a legacy that serves others, not I. His message is complex and takes attention when reading, but Mark's book will be easy to use as a reference point. I intend to read it again</review-text>

		<review-text>Hint to anyone thinking of actually buying this book: Read chapter one. That is the book. Everything else is inconsistent self help drivel. I made the mistake of purchasing the book at my local independent bookstore. Manson came up with a whiz bang title and a good first chapter. The other chapters have little or no relationship to the first. Two stars for a clever title. Don't waste your time on Manson's incoherent ramblings.</review-text>

		<review-text>Disappointed I didn't read more of the reviews and ended up wasting my money. Makes some good points in places but these are often points that have already been made by others who he references and you are much better off reading their work instead. Nothing new here. Lots of swearing that didn't particularly bother me in itself but the tone does come across as immature and self aggrandising and the whole thing is poorly put together (particularly the second half). Also comes across as chauvinistic e.g. when he describes a man in one of his stories potentially wishing bad of some other men this includes them wishing their wives are fat and/or ugly. When he talks of him and his wife using honesty to better each other he gives an example of him telling her 'the truth' when she asks him how she looks after getting dressed up for a night out so that she can go change and 'look better' *eye roll*.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is one of my favorite reads so far in 2017. I found myself actually laughing out loud while I was reading the first couple of chapters. There is a whole lot of curse words in the book but the way Manson says them is how a lot of people are thinking them. Overall I got a lot out of the book and have been able to apply some of the key points to my life and my interactions with others. I find myself looking at those people who say that they are going to do something different in a new light. It isn't cynicism as much as reality and dealing in reality gets things done so it is easier to cut through people's BS. I have already recommended the book to a couple of colleagues to read.</review-text>

		<review-text>I’ve never paid more than $9.99 for a Kindle book, and it’s been a very, very (, VERY) long time since I’ve re-read a book (because there are just so damn many other books out there to read), and I’ve never certainly finished reading a book then turned to the first page and started reading it over again just to be sure I caught everything. But all of the above is true with this book. It’s one of those gems whose title promised one sort of read, but whose text is so thought-provoking and sometimes so startling that you’re forced to wonder what the hell you’ve been thinking all this time. Actually, there were a few things that I’d already figured out for myself, but Manson takes those ideas and digs deeper and develops them further than I ever would have on my own.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book has helped create a shift in my thinking. After reading it (and now listening to the Audible version), I have shifted my focus away from minutia and people who push my buttons to what's really important.

I realized that little people and little things were bothering me, and that was MY responsibility to change, not theirs. I have stopped sweating the small stuff and it's made a difference in my stress levels and mindset.

Ever seen someone try to light a lighter that simply won't light? That's how it looks when someone who panics over stupid crap is around me now. Also, people who try to lead through fear, intimidation, and manipulation make me just shake my head. They used to really upset me, now it's almost like I'm watching them in a movie.

Read this book slowly. I read one chapter a day. It starts slow, almost like the author is trying to weed out those who aren't serious about change. The last several chapters are potentially life changing. Seriously.

I am in the personal development game. I have a podcast and have written books. There is a lot of nonsense, plagiarism, and so-called gurus pointing out the obvious in this industry. Manson is not one of them. So many Les Brown and Jen Sincero types are picking on your weaknesses like bullies. Not Manson. He tells it straight, challenges you to wake up and take responsibility for your life, happiness, success, and growth.

Kudos, Mark Manson. I have never read a book like this. I am now giving it as gifts to a select few in my life who will actually absorb it.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book relies on the overuse of the &quot;WTF&quot; manner of writing. It works for the first paragraph of the book, but the Author seems to be adding the F-Bomb every few sentences for the whole remainder of the book! He has good points to make - too bad he is overexcited by the use of the forbidden F-word to make these points. It makes the book sound like an adolescent who just realized he could swear. I thus found his message limited to &quot;no one gives a f---k about your happiness, go grab the world by the balls and stop whining&quot;. Stated multiple times in frequent f-punctuated phrases, his message becomes limited to a single rather uninspiring point, i.e. &quot;get over yourself&quot;. Mr. Manson's overuse of f-phrases did not help this reader to bracket or highlight his sociological statements or insights. Instead, they were lost in the harshness of the f-bombs he uses to describe them. The title is alluring, but I didn't expect that the whole book would would rely on the use of disruptive f-word vernacular to make his points.

I did buy the book because it had a neat title, and a good NYT review. Some of the best books I've ever read come back the title words, eventually, almost insidiously. This work does not have that advantage. Instead, the rhythm and meter of his f-messages disrupts communication of any possible threads of insight. Those nuggets remain buried by the over use of the f-word, and result in a vain attempt to make us &quot;f-ing&quot; listen to what he has to say. Needless to say, I think the book would have been more effective without them.</review-text>

But.. it really is not. I finished this book scratching my head wondering what the heck did I just read and why did I waste my time not getting anything really valuable or tangent enough to apply to real life. His examples and approach is all too broad and doesn't really guide you in any way in my opinion.

		<review-text>I was intrigued by the title, probably not a great reason to buy a book, but I ended up agreeing with some of the author's points. His Chapter 8, &quot;The Importance of Saying No&quot; is probably the least well-thought-out and convincing. That chapter felt mostly like whole cloth. The author also writes with a glib, snarky tone that I got used to but never fully liked. Listing a few sources, references, and credentials would have helped, too. Really, you're 33, and I'm supposed to take you seriously? Convince me what you're saying has some credibility elsewhere and then I'll think more highly of the self-help advice and psychology your peddling. Recommended with reservations.

		<review-text>Ugh. Book of empowerment turned self-help book, turned into a ploy for the author to just talk about his own privileged middle-class sob story. The last chapter was ridiculous. There were only a few good chapters in the middle of the book. Not a favorite.

Things I liked:
Not giving a **** is more like saving time for the things that really matter to you and not giving much thought to the things that don’t

When you are upset about something or feel like you or a situation isn’t good enough- it’s probably an issue with your values. You are probably measuring yourself or that experience in a really lame metric.

Whenever he started off a chapter with a historical story and tied it into the topic that was pretty cool.

Things I didn’t like:

This author was full of himself.

No one should start a sentence with “Now that I’m in my 30s….”, you don’t get to preface a sentence with that until you are like- 50.

The last chapter was awful and so off topic. I’m not even sure what he was trying to teach his readers. A huge part of me thinks that he just wrote this whole book so he could have a whole chapter dedicated to his privileged white-boy sob story.

I hate that this guy started off his career in writing with a dating advice blog because I feel like he would be a terrible human being to be in a relationship with.</review-text>

		<review-text>The book is a quick, light read. The underlying arguments are not particularly novel, but they are plainly presented in an easy to follow narrative. Support from scientific and/or other philosophic sources is light. My over arching problem with this book is the tone of the author. He comes across as the vain, slightly drunk “bro” that you meet in a bar that just has to tell you exactly what you are doing wrong with your life- and how his way is the only path. I had to actively fight my distaste for him to finish the book.

Anyway- the lessons here can easily be found elsewhere and often are more eloquently presented- but if you are looking for a light intro to mindfulness among other things- it’s not a terrible book.</review-text>

The book is a mixture of profane for shock value and some well thought out insights. The first part of the book seems designed to shock the reader and then the author gets into more of the content. Overall, the content in the book is not earth-shaking and presented in more of a conversational style rather than a textbook approach. I would have preferred for him to present the concept up front for each chapter in a meaty manner and then present his illustrative stories.

The author is obviously in love with himself and his &quot;insights&quot;. Most of the &quot;insights&quot; should be obvious to anyone who has not been in a coma for a long time. The issue here is that intelligent people understand these things but it is hard to put them into practice.

The author uses several concepts from Buddhism. Yet, there is only one reference to Judeo-Christian moral/ethical systems, which I found odd considering he shows many issues stemming from lacking an internal moral compass. A key point is that happiness comes from within (spiritual) metrics that a person measures themselves against -- I agree wholeheartedly with this. If someone had been raised in a Judeo-Christian background then he or she should have a spiritually based moral compass already.

Summary points:
1. You need to restrict what you care about to a key very important items which you have metrics to measure yourself against. The metric must be inward facing not based on physical goals. The modern focus on physical items (more money, a bigger house, a prettier wife/husband, ...) work to move a person away from an internal/spiritual focus.

2. Your current definition of happiness is likely based on bad metrics / poorly chosen metrics. You must be absolutely honest with yourself about the metrics to correct them. If you do not have good metrics, you will always be unhappy.

3. You are not special. This should be obvious to anyone with critical thinking skills -- definitionally obvious. The modern PC approach to self-esteem building is counterproductive and destructive on several levels. People need to get over themselves to be able to focus on a small set of concepts/goals that you want to be good at. It is not possible to be good at everything -- understand it, accept it and deal with it.

4. Life is not fair. Fairness is a delusion being pushed by the PC pushers. The lesson here is fairness is not important but rather how you deal with adversity you encounter in life. You can control your reaction to something which defines you as a person. It is important to not just react but rather to think about how you want to react / should react based on the metrics that you care about. The auto reaction does not go well most of the time.

5. Suffering is a natural and critical part of Life. The big question here is what are you willing to suffer for and why are you willing to do that? Life is a constant source of problems. Each person makes decisions all the time about what suffering will put up with and why. Active decision making is critical to improving your happiness and attitude.

The values of self-reliance, honesty, having a moral internal compass and selected a few key metrics to focus on is what makes for a happier life. The author's approach is interesting but the book could have been about 50% smaller if he just got to his points directly and left out the shock value material.</review-text>

		<review-text>I returned this book after flipping through it (not quickly, I might add). Topics are trite and it appears the book relies on its snappy title mostly. Instead, I recommend reading something of substance by authors who offer substantive and thought-provoking content and reasoning. Also had some friends tell me that while the title was compelling, it is much less so in content.</review-text>

		<review-text>At first, frank and straightforward words and thoughts make me wonder if this book is going be worth my time but as you read on, you realise the greatness of the points, thoughts and ideas presented and you cannot stop reading until finished. A must-read for anyone who wants to take responsibility for their actions and accept their imperfections, only that way the door opens to opportunities and to improving oneself. Negative feelings and setbacks actually are required to be able to change towards the positive. As the saying goes, &quot;dissatisfaction is the first step towards progress.&quot; Begin with yourself first and change your expectations of life. Don't expect the world to change, it's you that needs to change.</review-text>

		<review-text>This audiobook was very entertaining, and also enlightening. I learned a lot from listening to author Mark Manson's satirical look at most self-help ideas and how to just not care about things that are unimportant, or to essentially reprogram yourself to not care about things.

Manson summarizes his points well, and basically advises you to compartmentalize certain things, such as choosing what to care about while focusing on problems that are actually meaningful (= &quot;giving a f*** about the right things&quot;). He then states not to give a f*** about other things, by assigning them a lower priority in your daily life. Then, you must be okay with some bad things that occur; always trying to be positive isn't practical, and is stressful in itself. Just make up your mind not to give a F***, and it emotionally stabilizes you. Also, you must be responsible for your own life; it's good for your self-esteem not to keep blaming the circumstances for your problems. You also must understand the importance of being honest and to set boundaries, especially in relationships. This way, you're not set up for disappointment. Identity is another concept, who you are and what you possess--- because then any challenges will make you fear the potential loss of that identity you've clung to. Motivation; how to improve it by accepting failure and taking action. Mortality is also a concept of his--- how learning to be more comfortable with one's own mortality can make it easier to live your life stress-free.

Lastly, the story of Dave Mustaine, the lead singer and guitar player of the heavy metal band Megadeth, really hit home for me. He was fired from Mettalica in 1983 and on the long bus ride home, decided how to cope. He decided to form his own metal band and created Megadeth. But, Metallica outsold Megadeth and was more successful. Dave considered his career to be a failure unless he was more successful than the band that fired him, which wasn't the case. No matter how good Megadeth was and how many records/CDs they sold, they (and he) was a failure unless they outdid Metallica.

Really an introspective book that will make you laugh and make you think hard and long about what really matters. Highly recommended.</review-text>

		<review-text>When discussing why we shouldn't believe our own thoughts about ourselves, author brings up the case of woman who falsely accused her father of molestation. When describing what lead up to this, author described that the woman had recently become a feminist, and started having a lesbian relationship. So, basically, claims of sexual abuse might not be true, and claims will be more prone to happen if you're a lesbian feminist? Really? THIS had to be your example of a false belief?</review-text>

		<review-text>The name of the book will attract younger people which is good. Will repel older people which is bad. I highly recommend it to all. It isn’t about not caring about anything. Only what is important. I have never found another book that does this so well.
I just wish he would have learned a new word. Especially in the first part where the symbols are used overmuch.
You might want to hide the title of the book from others who won’t know the real meaning of the book!</review-text>

		<review-text>I really enjoyed this book. Quick read and easily relatable. I think it could apply to any age group too. It made me think about my own actions and how I can improve the way I approach things, communicate how I feel, be more direct and think about things. It also helps when you are dealing with people that are difficult to get along with, easy to sit back and think and observe instead of reacting all the time. It makes you realize what's important in life. I spent Thanksgiving with family and listened to so many people complaining about the smallest things and it made me realize what an incredible waste of energy that was. It's not what I would consider a life-changing book but definitely worth a look. As far as cursing or anything like that, I did not think it was excessive or offensive. The author is very matter of fact and bottom line. Life 101...</review-text>

		<review-text>Very easy read! I follow Mark Manson's online writings and always find his work enjoyable. For me, this book reiterates self-awareness tips in a modern/relatable tone; and helped me prioritize my personal values. Basically, the book told me that we have limited f's to give in our live. It acknowledges that the f's that we give life to are the ones that we value the most. To choose the best values to give an eff about is how to chose the best life to live. Manson elaborates on how to identify the areas in your life that are the root problem. Once we recognize the problem, we are able to choose how we respond and essentially choose to change for a better life. We will always run into problems throughout our life. Choose to resolve these problems by choosing to break the cycle of your perpetual unhappiness. Go after lifetime happiness and let go of chasing temporary &quot;highs.&quot; His writing is every pleasant.</review-text>

		<review-text>The stars are just for the fact that the premise (that we get far too worked up about too many things in life) is valid. This has been said many times before (15 years ago I believe there was a book called &quot;don't sweat the small stuff&quot;, and long before that books about &quot;letting go&quot;).
This book packages that same message in a Millennial writing style that involves using variations of the f-word 10 times per page. It is too crude and too opinionated for my taste. (in fact, if you repeat the title in full in the review, Amazon rejects it for containing profanity, that's ironic...)</review-text>

		<review-text>I recommend this book. Although the book follows the self-help book recipe of catchy title -&gt; anecdote -&gt; life tip -&gt; next chapter, the author manages to throw some really good nuggets of wisdom in.

However, I felt like the author gets too ahead of himself at times, almost as if he enjoys the sound of his written voice too much to care about being coherent. There are a couple parts of the book where he is flat out contradictory, which really annoyed me as one of my biggest peeves is when self-help books are misleading or destructive for the reader.

Another part I didn't enjoy is his backstory. He was essentially lazy middle-class white dude who spent years traveling and having sex. After he got tired of it, he learned the &quot;value of commitment.&quot; He didn't really study philosophy other than self-study, and doesn't have much to his name except a couple thousand highly opinionated and poorly backed, snake-oil style blog posts. Unless he is some kind of genius, I don't see how he is qualified to provide life advice?

The best way to describe this book is a strained effort to piece together all the nuggets of philosophy that the author has picked up over the decades. Some or many parts of the book are wrong and confusing, but like the author says, it's ok to be wrong :)</review-text>

		<review-text>The book makes some good points. But his &quot;I used to get girls all the time&quot; attitude/ego comes out a little too often. As the reader, I don't care about the author's past. Ultimately did not finish the book because this ego came out one too many times for me.</review-text>

		<review-text>WOW! I am not even sure how to describe this book. First off, the language is a little bit &quot;in your face&quot; as you can likely infer from the title. And I am not a fan of profanity for shock value. But the way the book was written, the language did not take away from the book. Rather, it made me feel the raw emotion and passion of a person who had made numerous mistakes in his life. And that is where the message comes in which I interpreted as this: stop for a moment and think about the things that dominate your thoughts, feelings, worries, etc. Are these the things you will care about on your deathbed. For most of us, the answer to this question is a resounding NO! So forget about the things you don't truly care about and start to address the things you actually do give a #%$* about.

There are a million self-help/life improvement books with similar messages. I have read most of them. However, this book conveyed the message in a way that got through to me on more personal level. I listened to the audiobook, which may provide a different experience than reading. But I felt like I was listening to a friend who was giving me a personal cautionary tale. The book had a lighthearted, yet serious tone throughout and then in the final chapter the author went full-on sober and philosophical. The final chapter was deep and it perfectly wrapped up the book in a way that I have not experienced before. The writing was brilliant. Never before had I finished a book and just sat in silence thinking &quot;holy #*%&amp;!&quot;

Finally, the author leaves a bit of an Easter Egg in the final chapter by discussing a book by a different author and the message tied in seamlessly. I immediately added this book to my reading list.

This is a book that I will go back to at least once a year.</review-text>

		<review-text>Although the concept in this book is good - caring about things that are worth caring about - it's not a deep book at all. I listened to the Audible version and returned it afterward for refund. The problem I had with it was the sense that Mark Manson conveys - that he has the world all figured out at 30-something. Now that I am older, what I know is that the more I age and the more I know, the more I realize what I don't yet know. It doesn't appear that Mark Manson has realized yet how much he doesn't yet know. His way of looking at the world comes across as a very &quot;comfortable way to think&quot; (as a friend says about people who delude themselves into thinking that they know more than they really do). Manson's words are those of the confident youth with much yet to know about life. While on the surface his words are entertaining, brash, and encouraging, they don't tell anywhere near the whole truth and very likely some years from now Manson will end up looking back on this book as a fairly naive period in his philosophy on life. To me this book is typical of the modern pop gurus of the blog world - more superficial pop psychology from oddly cynical yet overconfident world of the younger who think they have it all figured out - not great life advice.</review-text>

		<review-text>I'm so confused by this book. It only talks about its title subject matter for a very short while; the author then begins to write incredibly generic self-help psycho babble for the remainder of the publication. I purchased the audio book; as I was listening to it, for the vast majority of it, I couldn't help but think: &quot;what in the world does this have to do anything?&quot; It's almost as if this work is an experiment that tests whether or not we'll notice it's nothing but a collection of random sentences gathered by a computer from across the internet.

Additionally, I myself am crass so I don't mind swear words; I just find most of them unnecessary here, he's trying too hard to be cool.

Pretty worthless book, I wish I could get my Audible credit back. Perplexed by it being a best seller and having mostly positive reviews.</review-text>

		<review-text>An utter waste of time. If you've read any business book or attended an annual business conference in the last decade, you already know every illustrative &quot;example&quot; that Mr. Manson presents. In addition, he repeats his opening premise again, and again, to the point where you want to scream at him, &quot;Do you think I'm stupid?? Get to the point, man!&quot; I imagine that as blog posts, each piece could be valuable, coming back to a central theme of the blog. But as a book, it's rubbish.
Then comes the arrogant moralism: &quot;You are responsible for dealing with everything that has happened to you.&quot; Mr. Manson tries to split semantical hairs; e.g., others are &quot;to blame,&quot; but you are &quot;responsible.&quot; But as he gives no account at all of the massive psychological damage that childhood abuse does to rational decision-making, it ends up being just more &quot;Dr. Laura/Phil-ultra-conservative-punditry-masquerading-as-therapy&quot; claptrap. (One wonders what a licensed mental health medical professional might have suggested as edits.)
Victims of abuse are not inherently capable of making the same rational decisions that others take for granted. That's kinda why it's called &quot;abuse.&quot; It takes intensive therapy—and yes, significant effort on the abused—to get to a place where the abused can trust others, and make better decisions with long-term impacts.
Also, there is the repeated insistence that the author &quot;gives no f—,&quot; about what he's written, while ignoring the fact that purposefully completing the process of writing, editing, publishing and promoting an actual bound &amp; printed book is prima facie evidence of &quot;giving a f—.&quot; Mr. Manson fatally wounds his only positive argument.
Lastly: dude, you probably need to talk to someone about your obsession with sex. It's a little icky. Again: blog posts ≠ book.
There are so many superior alternatives if you're looking for how to deal with OCD, anxiety (especially modern, tech-driven anxiety) or past abusive relationships. If you number among those unfortunate people (Hi, and welcome!), it is _not_ your fault, and things do get better, with work and qualified help. But this book will set you back several paces; you don't need the stress.</review-text>

		<review-text>I wanted to like it, but it just was not for me. The book takes basic ideas from several philosophies and skims the top of them, relating the ideas to modern fast-paced, wealth-driven society. I like that idea and wanted this to be so much better. The author attacks some other self-help strategies and techniques (derived from the same original philosophies), but his criticisms show a misunderstanding of them, or a willful misinterpretation. So, if you have tried and disliked other techniques, this book may be great for you!</review-text>

I agree with the whole &quot;stop looking at Facebook and TV' part but who doesn't know that?

		<review-text>Well, I've read just about every personal growth and self-help book around and while lots of this book is just plain common sense it's nice to hear a repetitive voice reminding you of what you already know in your heart but don't practice enough. Clearly this author has been through therapy to work through issues and shares his knowledge with the rest of us who need it as well.

&quot;Outrage porn&quot; I'm so glad it's got a name!!!!

There are times in the book that I feel like he minimizes child abuse and molestation but you know that they say: Take what you can and leave the rest. All in all it's worth the read.</review-text>

		<review-text>In 2011 I read Mark Manson's first book Models: Attract Women Through Honesty (a book for which I wrote a five star review on Amazon as well) and it effectively slammed the door and liberated me from a very painful and frustrating period in my life. A period I call the &quot;The Pickup Years&quot; and it was a time when I put my trust in a bunch of losers wearing feather boas and large top hats who I thought held all the answers to my problems with women. In that book Mark showed me that so called pick up techniques were a very poor way of approaching women and that it was used as a way to hide and protect yourself and to mask your shame. In that book Mark showed me that while much harder than using lame pick up techniques that expressing my vulnerability and being more direct were often the more successful route to take in the long run. Less than a year later I found an amazing woman and married her in many ways because of Mark's book. The only way to win &quot;The Game&quot; was to leave it.

Now he has (finally!) released his second book and I'm happy and amazed to say that it's actually a much better book than Models. While that books target demographic is men this book could and in my opinion should be read by everyone. One thing this book is not though is your typical self-help book. Walk into any book store and you'll find shelf after shelf of books with smiling toothy looking gurus on the cover looking like the perfect embodiment of human achievement. I don't know why but I always felt uneasy with books like this (It's the same feeling I get from being around used car salesmen). But when you look inside the covers its all the same generic b.s. advice. Be positive, fake it till you make it, visualize, find your power animal. After reading about a hundred of these books I can tell you that about 90% of what's in them doesn't work, or at least doesn't work very well. This book however is very, very different.

Turn to the contents page and you'll find chapters titled: Don't Try, Happiness Is A Problem, You Are Not Special, The Value of Suffering, You're Wrong About Everything (But So Am I), Failure Is The Way Forward, The Importance of Saying No, and lastly my favorite chapter, And Then You Die. A Tony Robbins book this is not and you know what? That's a great thing. Despite the depressing sounding chapters this book will give you one counterintuitive technique after another of ways to let your problems go (your problems aren't special either), truly improve your life and your correct your values. Give it a try and give those other self-help books the bird because I think Mark has really given us something special with this one. There truly is value in suffering and just try and not be motivated by meditating on your own mortality.

So like 2011 when Mark helped me out of my PUA phase I feel this book really has helped me out of my constant reading of superficial self-help books and truly helped me identifying and seek out things that I believe matter in life. In short this book absolutely deserves to be read and in my opinion it should be read way more than just once.</review-text>

		<review-text>I guess this is a self-help book for people who don't read self-help books.

The ideas in this book are not original, so rest assured you'll be able to find them elsewhere. Mostly, you pay for the &quot;voice&quot; and presentation style of the material.

It wasn't for me. As someone who has read some self-help books, this is probably the worst I've come across.

Example: He describes life like climbing a rope, and says &quot;The joy is in the climb itself.&quot; Seriously?

Major credibility lost when he describes getting caught with marijuana in middle school and the peaceful divorce of his parents as traumatic and requiring 10 years of therapy.</review-text>

		<review-text>I give this book 4 stars due to the fact that most of the personal appeal in the book started with the last chapter. Sure, there were some anecdotes in every chapter that described his life, connecting to the deeper philosophy of the book. But the majority of the emotion came at the end, with dry theories and hypotheticals in the foreground of the book. Manson however does a decent job at keeping us reading, even if it’s some here and there. I personally couldn’t leave the book for more than a few days at a time, even with a hefty schedule. Overall, the outline and flow of the book was easy to comprehend and understand, and the meaning behind it wasn’t deciphered. I give 4 stars because, even though I enjoyed the read, I couldn’t connect too deeply until the more I read.</review-text>

		<review-text>I almost didn't read this book because the title gives a false impression of Mark Manson's true message. While reading chapter one, with the &quot;f-bomb&quot; in almost every sentence, I decided that if the book continued that way, I'd give up on it. Beginning with chapter two, Manson had pretty well gotten most of the expletive repetition out of his system, and continued on with keen observations based mostly on his own life, often written with humor, but offering truths worth thinking about for anyone interested in living a satisfying and honest life. The title may imply that one shouldn't &quot;care&quot; about anything, but that impression if furthest from the true message, which in a nut shell is - &quot;choose carefully that which you care about and discard the rest&quot;, or put another way, &quot;choose your battles wisely&quot;.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is a light and airy read, and I was expecting a bit more depth. Could be my own fault, I guess. Basically, it's like taking the philosophies of Thic Nhat Hanh (a Zen Buddhist) and making them digestible for those raised in the internet-age. If you're at all familiar with Buddhism the themes and ideas are very familiar, but the writing style is catered to keep the attention of someone whose only read internet blurbs. Also, not a fan of the author's numerous attempts at witty humor, which to me fall flat and even make it less readable.</review-text>

		<review-text>I really enjoyed this book and was surprised at how well written it was and insightful. While reading it, I began to see things that it was describing about myself and my friends - I feel that with this knowledge, I can eventually become a better person than I was before reading it. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because the book is written from the point of view of an American Male in their 30's and I feel like it is speaking directly to those types of people; I would buy this book to give other male friends in their 30's but I wouldn't recommend it to any of my female friends. It's not that it's sexist (although some other reviews do believe it to be), but rather I see more guys laughing about the situational humor in the book than ladies as most of the experiences described are from the point of view of a male.</review-text>

It goes a little deeper than most self help books - but really after the first chapter the language calms down so skip that one if the word offends you! There isn’t anything important in that first chapter anyway. I’d hate for someone to miss out on the gems in this book - but I think the point is that if you are offended by the F word, then you probably are not ready to go as deep as this book leads the reader.</review-text>

		<review-text>Unlike other self-help gurus, Mark doesn't promise you a happily after life. Indeed, he admits upfront that life would always be painful no matter what. The genius of Mark lies in challenging you to re-examine your values and negative emotions with a healthy dose of skepticism, and take full responsibility of your life. Good life = Success+Money+Fame? Negative emotions = Bad + Someone else's fault? Mark turns the conventional widsom on what constitutes a good life on its head, and guide us towards building a more sustainable path towards happiness.

I grew up drinking a lot of cool aid thinking I'm special - destined to achieve great things and adored by family and friends. Yet over the years, I discovered that this type of mentality has cultivated an entitled mentality that made my life miserable. Mark instroduced a completely new perspective for me: I'm not special, life is full of pain, and I might be wrong most of the time. Yet by acknowledging that I'm not special, I'm liberated from my solitary confinement, and seek out others more readily; by acknowledging pain, I no longer need to bottle up my feelings until they inevitably explode, or feel demoralized. Rather, I have learned to view it from a neutral light, and use it as an opportunity to examine the situation, and think of ways to make it better; perhaps most importantly, by admiting that we're mostly wrong all the time, just less wrong over time, my self-worth is finally detached from having to be right all the time. This also alleviate my fear of rejection, and help me move faster in my job.

Mark shattered my childhood fairy tale vision, and I emerged as a more mature person. For that, he has my eternal gratitude.</review-text>

		<review-text>Note: my initial review of this book was not accepted by Amazon. I'm assuming it is because I use the exact same four letter spelling as in the title of the book. In other words I actually can't use the title of the book in a review of the book or a word that's in the title of the book in a review of the book. Okay let me try again substituting &quot;darn&quot;. Strange policy. That's what happens when you use an algorithm instead of human thought.

I'm giving this book 5 stars somewhat reluctantly. At times it was difficult to keep going as some of the author's writing seems to be over the top advice I've heard before. There actually is not much new in this book, however it reminds one of what one already knows in a rather different manner than one usually finds in self-help books. The main advice one finds in this book is to focus on what matters and not give a &quot;darn&quot; about the rest.

On page 208 I found this quote:

&quot;You too are going to die, and that's because you too were fortunate enough to have lived.&quot;

I think I'm going to paste that on my wall as a reminder to keep things in perspective. Most of the things we give a &quot;darn&quot; about are trivial in comparison.</review-text>

		<review-text>I greatly enjoyed the book and his philosophy. An interesting and worthwhile read, though at times he did seem to contradict himself. Even so, it did not take away from key messages. Please note that anyone offended by the F-bomb should skip chapter 1; obviously done only to kick off and tie in the subject matter to the attention-grabbing title. Call it good marketing. After that, he tones it down considerably and articulates his philosophical thoughts in a more mature and &quot;subtle&quot; manner (pun is intended). :-). Good book!</review-text>

		<review-text>Interesting view of how to conduct your life based on what is really important to you. What do you really care about. And those things you should not invest your time and soul into. Gets a little repetitive and heady toward the end. I could related to many ways to avoid personal grief by not not really caring about certain things I do not have any control over or no interest in. Also, relationships are seen from a more practical aspect which includes looking at oneself as opposed to blaming others for your condition in life.</review-text>

Then she read it.. And realized she was giving a &quot;F&quot; about the wrong things...
As with any self help book... You take what you want from it... If it helps just to get you too think about things differently... Then in my eyes... That's a win.

		<review-text>I do not recommend this book for people over 35, or pretty much anyone who has made any attempt at educating themselves in an effort towards personal growth. As I read the book I was distracted by a sense that the author is well read, but young and inexperienced. The straw man for his advice is too much of a caricature: arrogant, self-absorbed, womanizing, shallow male trying to climb the corporate ladder. It’s far too easy to give advice to these kinds of people. Similarly, he compares his ‘self-help’ philosophy to others that require people to stand in front of a mirror and tell themselves they are happy. I’ve been reading advice/personal growth/self-help books for years, and have yet to run across one that asks this of it’s reader. This is like writing a diet and health book for people who stuff their face continuously with pizza and soda, and comparing other diet books that ask their readers to simply imagine themselves as slim; even the simplest advice would make a difference to this target group. One other area I took issue with were his stories of taking ‘risks’ when he was in his early twenties to start his internet advice business, and the resulting life advice he offered from those experiences. Many people with children or other dependents will likely agree that ‘risk’ when you’re single and in your twenties is vastly different than the risks one takes when you are middle or late aged with a family. I commend Mark for being a successful professional writer and advice-giver. And in all fairness he may not have intended his book for the average 40+ year old. Regardless, I do believe this book was billed in a certain way that it did not live up to. He used attention getting titles and descriptions that ultimately did not lead to any deeper, useful content for me.</review-text>

		<review-text>WHEW that was tough to get through!
I agree with the author's concepts (which are not his own). So that's why he gets 2 stars. The missing stars are due to his inability to form a well written sentences, his glib oversimplification of the human condition, his blanket statements about &quot;what is,&quot; and how he's constantly referencing how many woman he's slept with.
I could write a super long review citing all of the things that were so horrific about this book, but then that would be me wasting MORE time on sweet Mark.

		<review-text>Generally speaking, it's a good book about some philosophy of the attitude to life. However, the author makes a lot of claims without scientific evidence backing them up.
The general ideas like choosing your values, admitting problems, and taking responsibilities are good for refreshing the mind in an atmosphere of encouraging &quot;positive thinking&quot;. However, it lacks specific techniques that are shown to be useful. Most of the time, the change of mind doesn't lead to change of behavior. Also, the author has a lot of speculations about social phenomena and their causes, solely based on his own observations. It is not much different from other self-help books in this regard. To be fair, those things are not critical for the book. I think it's worth reading. And readers can think about his ideas. But it's not as scientific as I would like it to be.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is an awesome read. I've been struggling in some areas in my life. I assume everyone does. However, I was thinking about seeking professional help. After reading this book (and I do not recommend replacing professional help when truly needed) I was able to figure out how to manage my perspective on my immature view on certain things on an emotional level. It is wonderful information that I've used to improve my relationships. I've had an intuition about some topics in the book, but Manson does a great job at putting those hard to explain concepts into words and giving great &quot;to the point&quot; examples.

Manson talks about taking responsibility, how we have to choose what to care about, the importance of values and how we should think twice about values we choose to live for, how we tend to ignore things that threaten our identity (the image we have of ourselves), the unavoidable certainty of death, and many more cool concepts. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for personal growth.</review-text>

		<review-text>So, I gave into all the hype and decided to give this book a gander - and I was pleasantly surprised! I'm typically not a fan of self-help, but I found this particular book to be &quot;different&quot; than most self-help, and it seemingly had a lot of relevance to my life.
As a person who overthinks most situations and worries about things that probably aren't worth worrying about, the logic of not caring rang true to me. While Manson states that a lot of the thought processes he is emphasizing is counter intuitive, I found the entire thing to actually be very intuitive and the logic sound.
I recommend this read to anyone - while I don't think people can inherently change, they can certainly change how they approach situations, and this can lead to a happier being.</review-text>

		<review-text>I am rather selective about the books I read, and therefore, rarely give bad reviews. This book is ok. It has some good advice, and some bad. I call this book a &quot;bible&quot; for the masses, as it teaches you to be content of where you are. Perhaps, a good path to happiness, or perhaps not. I think being content of where you are equals stagnation. A person always needs something better to look forward to, and to be motivated for personal growth. This book also goes in circles and sometimes doesn't make sense. The author definitely has a skill of making everything seem a true even if one statement contradicts another.</review-text>

		<review-text>I enjoyed all chapters except for Something Beyond Our Selves which read like a school essay and frankly was not very much convincing; not very much from the heart, not something deeply lived-through – not yet. I only wish the author could have spared the reader those sexist remarks (fortunately they are not that many) because sexism makes any valuable thought sound unoriginal and even tasteless. And, above all, sexism does not agree with the author's preached values, nor does it agree with his evolution from a womanizer to somebody reborn. I guess it's also possible that sexism is just dust from his previous self and as such will go away with time, once acknowledged. Or maybe the book's target is the dudes, not a general audience. Also, after I gave this book four stars simply because I'd enjoyed it, I started to hesitate if it was a fair judgement of it as a self-help book. And I think that the category self-help is a little overstated here despite the book's rather straightforwardly prescriptive character. I know I did read this for fun (and in hope of learning something new; the title certainly helped me to purchase the book out of amusement and curiosity), and it was fun allright. Of course I learned a few things – mostly anecdotes about some more or less famous people's lifes. Or that the most important is living by your actual values, not the ones you've learned from other people and you even don't realize they are not yours; or that you should get out of your head and do something (not forgetting about the consequences though, but staying positive at the same time). The few bits from the author's life were ok too (one of them life-changing). But as a self-help book I can't give it more than solid 3 stars. It's insightful only as somebody's life experience put into orderly fashion, not as an expert (like psychotherapist's) help.</review-text>

That was probably more of a fault of mine than it was the book (probably unrealistic expectations on my part).

The book was pretty somber. I had hoped, along the way to letting go of crap, that I'd feel a tone change or even an emotional change. Neither occurred.

Even further, there are things in life that matters and things that don't...and that we should care about those things that do matter.

		<review-text>Over many years I've read quite a few books on the subject of what I call 'self analysis and improvement' and this book has provided more to think about than any other.

Maybe it's my age showing through but two aspects of the early passages were significant;

1. The first chapter was heavy going through the (in my opinion) excessive use of a particular word. It's all very well using the word in the title for emphasis but if I hadn't believed the book would overall be useful to me I would not have tolerated the first chapter. I'm pleased that in this case I chose to overcome my prejudice that over-use of that word is the refuge of the inarticulate but I did not enjoy realising that by the end of the chapter I had become somewhat desensitised to it.

2. The concept that the vast majority of us are not special (by definition) so we would do well to start behaving accordingly struck a chord with me. That concept was a strong validation of my own thoughts about myself and attitude towards those that think they are (so of course I welcomed it) but it made even stronger the effect of the descriptions of how to embrace that and what to do with it.

Overall, a good read and good food for thought.</review-text>

I find a book with the F word in the title pretty hard to resist, which is why I chose to buy this one, even though I hate self-help books. The first few times I read the F word in the book, I smiled. Eventually, it stopped being funny. I think that several of the ideas in this book make sense, for example (p 7), &quot;...we humans have the luxury of being able to have thoughts about our thoughts.&quot; Thinking about your thinking, I think, is an important part of good mental health. The author gives the example of situations involving a couple of musicians. One's less success than expected bothered him a lot, the other guy realized that things turned out well for him in spite of the fact that he was kicked out of the Beatles and replaced by Ringo. In fact, he provides lots of examples like this. He also debunks the whole Power of Positive Thinking concept, saying that all that positive thinking happens because we think that the way we are without those affirmations is somehow not okay. I'm not a proponent of affirmations, so I'm not sure I have an opinion on that.

There are a few other concepts that I remember off the top of my head that are useful, that of having to work really hard to be really good at things (the 10,000 hours of Gladwell's Outliers), the fact that You Are Not Special (wish my acquaintances could say that about their kids and themselves), the fact that most struggle with mortality and although we all know we are going to die someday, we don't (can't) deal with that in a healthful way.

It's not so much that I don't like the author's ideas or in your face writing style, it's more the fact that I find others' ideas more useful. For example, best book of all time on this subject: Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl. Content of the Subtle Art pales in comparison. Coming Home: Uncovering the Foundations of Psychological Well-being by Dr. Dicken Bettinger and Natasha Swerdloff is also better...but you have to have a certain level of background knowledge about this thinking about your thinking to &quot;get&quot; that book. Also, The Power of Meaning: Crafting a Life That Matters by Emily Esfahani Smith has a few flaws, but overall, is a really useful book that explains that searching for happiness is not the path to happiness. Doing good deeds will lead to happiness (as my existentialist son points out, we do nice things for people because it makes us feel good, a point about which I can't disagree).

In summary, while the author makes a few good points in this over the top in your face sort of story, by the end, the novelty of excessive F Word usage wore off. A better book (besides the ones already mentioned) 10% Happier by Dan Harris. Entertaining, useful...and very few swear words.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is one of the best books that I have read in years! Mark Manson's writing style is quick, clever, and enjoyable to read.

		<review-text>Mark Manson's book will tell you not what you want to hear, but what you need to hear. This book will anger you, it will depress you, and it will inspire you. However, most importantly, it will make you think. It will make you think about things you've never thought about, and things you probably don't want to think about, and that's okay. In fact, it's not only okay, it's important. I will most likely reading this book again when I have the chance to take notes, as it is definitely worth paying more attention to the things said here.</review-text>

		<review-text>I have read many,many books in the self help genre but this one -this one- was as if it was written by someone looking right into my head and clearly enunciating the inner issues I didn't know how to define but which I knew were killing my ability to live a satisfying life.

In reading many books trying to cure my fear of failure and persistent inaction I was heading in the exactly the right direction and the wrong direction at the same time.

It turns out I was looking all the time for validation and certainty. But uncertainty as I have learnt from this book has so much to offer - and I have a stack of it already!

I recommend this book for anyone who feels 'stuck' in life, overwhelmed to the point of inaction perpetually, and who feels like everyone else is succeeding, while they can't seem to get the hang of living and always 'stuff it up'.</review-text>

		<review-text>To all ;those who gave this book one star: Yes, there's profanity, sometimes juvenile humor and the content is an eclectic mix of various teachings. But it covers a lot of ground in a short book. My favorite part was his analysis of the epidemic of entitlement in our culture, especially among the young who were subjected to programs to enhance self-esteem in schools and sports programs. As could have easily been anticipated, the programs were failures that at worst created a large group of people unable to handle criticism and different points of view. I believe they call them &quot;snowflakes&quot;.</review-text>

		<review-text>I listened to the Audible version, which was a good narration, no complaints. There was a lot I didn't like about this book in the beginning and I almost shut it down for good. I thought he tried too hard with the profanity shock value and I am not anti profanity if it fits. Also the author's youth is very apparent in some of his stories (e.g., a breakup that felt like a thousand stomach punches or some such thing). However, overall he wrote a really good book. Actually the faults I had with the book (other than the profanity) were directly or indirectly discussed in the 'we are all flawed' narratives. I really appreciated the discussions on entitlement and how it develops and how it messes people up. Overall, it was an approachable and modernized translation of some Buddhist teachings and a good prompt to get you re-evaluating what you give your time to. Everyone needs to do that at least from time to time. I will probably listen to it again and will definitely recommend it.</review-text>

		<review-text>Not really what I expected, given the title. It's more of a list of things to focus on that are more important than the unimportant things that occupy less effective minds. There's a bit of contradiction with the anti-positivity framework. A lot of the advice is based on positive psychology research without realizing it, or at least not acknowledging it. The argument that people are too entitled is repeated throughout and comes off sounding like the tired rant that participation trophies are the root of all life's modern-day problems. Other than that, the book challenges conventional thinking and is weirdly motivational in the first few chapters.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book takes a much needed departure from the scores of other self-improvement books. Almost all the other books talk about how you (the reader) is unique /special / divine entity - one of a kind in the universe .. blah.. blah..
This book instead brings the reader back to reality by bluntly stating that:
* one is just another guy/girl
* good and bad things will happen to you. What reveals your character is how you react to it
* happiness comes from solving problems
* stay away from victim hood cliches
* it is ok to fail... as long as you learn something from it</review-text>

Overall, I can't say there was anything in this book that I scoffed at, and it was presented in a manner that might initially be off-putting, but if you got past the title, then chances are you won't have too many issues with the presentation.

I suppose that's part of the appeal of the book, and maybe even part of the marketing strategy. Nevertheless, the advice inside is really, really good. The author takes a bunch of &quot;common wisdom&quot; and completely turns it on its head, explaining why it's just plain wrong. Best of all, if you apply his advice, you might just find yourself feeling quite differently about your life and daily struggles (like, better). Highly recommended!</review-text>

Finally, I found the first half of the book to be much stronger than the second half, which is more philosophical (hence the 4 stars).

		<review-text>I didn’t just grab this book off a shelf. I am a big fan of Manson and his teachings. He seems to be better at telling men how to pick up women than he is at telling people how to live their life. The problem with this book is that there are no real solutions. Of course there are some things that we should care about and some we should not. We are not bound to material things and we’re all going to die. Manson tells a few interesting stories, but he fails to connect them to the points that he is trying to make. Telling someone to not give a f is not telling them HOW. There was not enough content to warrant a book. Manson does better with articles. He can present snippets of information in an entertaining way. The main point from his book that I enjoyed was that there will always be suffering and problems to solve. You have to find what you are willing to suffer for and what means enough to you to devote your focus to. This book strips away the trivialities of life and asks you to zero in on what is meaningful. You have to set values for yourself and take responsibility for what happens to you and how you react. Basically we know nothing, we’re all going to die, and none of it matters.</review-text>

		<review-text>Didn't know anything about this author or his writing and picked this book up based on a friend's recommendation. The beginning of this book is good. He puts forth some useful and practical devices for spiritually navigating in 21st century America. He combines and synthesizes many different philosophies and schools of thought into one simple succinct message. However, this is only if you can get over the immature and dumbed-down writing style. His use of profanity, while at the beginning can be quirky and informal, quickly becomes gimmicky and cringe inducing.

By the middle and second half, the book really starts to go off the rails and the author's own issues really become glaringly obvious. He comes off quite self-absorbed and is constantly humble bragging about his promiscuous past, cushy middle class upbringing, and blessed life. During many passages, I would stop reading and ask myself, why is he writing about this right now? Why does anyone need this info? How does this further his goal here? Answer: I don't know.

The further and further along I went, the more his writing just started to grate on me. This book is really poorly written in many ways. I actually stopped reading at page 172 because I literally felt like the author had completely wasted my time. Under the subtitle, Boundaries, the author spends 2/3 of a page, in his best bro voice, paraphrasing the main plot to Romeo &amp; Juliet. I felt like a complete fool after reading it. Why, why, why would he do that? It's blatant padding.

It's sad to me that writing of this poor caliber can be a best seller. The ideas are good and he has some useful things to say, but he should really learn how to write first.</review-text>

My only real gripe with book is that the title really doesn't do the book justice. It follows from the web blog but the book really offers much more.

I read this book because it was recommended to me by a shipmate. Her job is to care about others, and basically, to give a fork about a lot of stuff. Kind of ironic. I liked the title and thought I'd give it a shot.

Mark Manson is funny and has a great way of explaining things. His advice is not academic. His stories are interesting and universal.

I didn't find anything in this book earth-shattering. What I did find was that I already do most of these things, but now I can see a better reason as to why I should keep doing what I am doing.

What's missing is a conclusion to tie everything together. There's a lot of what and why but not a lot of how. The reader should be prepared to step back on his/her own and reflect. There are no exercises or empty pages to complete (well, duh. I read this on my kindle). I did appreciate the depth of each of the chapters. I would have liked a conclusion.

Some reviewers note the author's youth, but I feel that it was a real asset to the subject, and I feel grateful on Mark's behalf that his journey has been so fruitful, and more importantly, that he is so attentive. Because honestly, at 59 years old, I am just now realizing all of these things, but have not appreciated them in the way that Mark's analysis has succinctly fitted them on pages that I can read five times in a row. To say this book helped me would be an understatement. This book validates that little voice in your head, and having been validated, empowers it. My thoughts now wander among memories and the present, hunting down the values that underly all situations. Its like having been given a key at once both strange and familiar. This book has helped me stop beating myself up about a lot of stuff, hiw life turned out, and look anew at things, especially through the lense of values. So, thank you Mark for all you wne through that enabled you to write it. God bless you. Write another.</review-text>

		<review-text>OK, so with this title, I was expecting something feisty that would grab me by the unmentionables. Unfortunately, it's all downhill after the headline. Clickbait in a binding? While I can subscribe to many of the author's points, I found the approach rather shallow and wishy-washy. I wanted a hot curry and got cold gruel instead. In fairness, some of the sections are amusingly constructed, but some of them are also nauseatingly sentimental. Three stars is about the best I can do on this one, I'm afraid.</review-text>

		<review-text>The author describes his work as a &quot;Self-Help book for people who hate Self Help books.&quot; This book articulates a value system to which I subscribe. Despite the title, the key is to figure out what is worth caring about. It is written like a conversation with a wise friend who is part smart ass, part great philosopher. The hard truths he walks readers through are self-evident but need to be said.
1. Take responsibility for everything, regardless who is at fault.
2. Recognize the existence of uncertainty and acknowledge one's ignorance.
3. Be willing to discover mistakes in failure to improve.
4. Embrace rejection, the ability both to say and hear no.
5. Contemplate one's mortality.
The author is somewhat of an enigma. He writes frequently and requires users to subscribe (pay) for his writings. He is brutally honest, has great ideas, and uses Wordpress (of course)!</review-text>

		<review-text>I like this book, and I like his reasoning, but some of the insight he offers seems to contradict itself. I’ll highlight the three best points of this book, but also the contradictions associated with each. I’ll also attempt to clarify each contradiction, based on what I think is the unstated point.

1. You should not constantly care about making everything right, but should narrow in on the things that matter most. Caring about everything constantly stems from a feeling of entitlement that you deserve to have everything right all the time, perhaps due to a glorified self-image or feelings that you deserve to be or need to be extraordinary. Carrying oneself this way leads to feelings of inadequacy, and ultimately results in being upset about being inadequate, manifesting into a downward spiral of depression. Alternately, one can and should avoid having a glorified self-image, but use the feeling of inferiority as the basis for improvement. According to Manson, not only is this how you can become great at something, but it is also what leads to happiness, because happiness is based, in part, on feeling like you are solving your problems. [Contradiction: I find that he is coming down hard on feelings of inadequacy, but instead just advocating his own version of self-imposed inadequacy. I guess he is saying that the feelings of inadequacy should come from yourself rather than from superficial comparisons. This makes sense if he is saying that people should focus narrowly on the things they care about being inadequate about, rather than feeling inadequate about everything all the time. However, acknowledging inadequacy is still an essential part of his equation. He should clarify that taking ownership of the inadequacy, embracing it, and making sure it is properly focused, is what makes the difference. Either way, I still appreciate his point.]

2. Though you cannot do away with all your problems, and though you should not avoid confronting your problems, you can make choices that determine which types of problems you will be likely to deal with (&quot;choosing your problems&quot;). You should direct yourself to &quot;choose the problems&quot; which you are best fit to deal with (or even enjoy). [Contradiction: Choosing alternate problems seems like a way of avoiding bigger problems, and thus just another way of avoiding problems. I think he is right that avoiding problems can lead to bigger problems down the road, and I think he also has a point about choosing the problems you want to deal with, but I’m not sure that always choosing a lesser or a different problem, like sucking it up as an alternative to confrontation, is constantly the best way to go, and seems like it might even perpetuate the types of denials and avoidance that he is warning about.]

3. You can gauge your success at dealing with your problems by redefining what it means to be successful (“choosing your metric”). At the same time, giving everything a positive spin is an improper way of dealing with adversity. [Contradiction: redefining your definition of success, per Manson’s recommendation, seems like a way of just giving things a positive spin. Again, I see the value in what he is saying, but he needs to distinguish properly between these two points. The warning against &quot;positive spins&quot; is probably against putting an unreasonably positive spin on something after the fact, and in turn, using this as a way to live in denial about adversity. On the other hand, redefining one’s definition of success is something to be done before the fact, and to be used as a guiding principle, no matter whether the outcome is success or failure (though the proper guiding principle, should in theory lead to more instances of feeling successful).]</review-text>

		<review-text>As someone who has given far too many f***s about far too many things their entire life, this book was exactly the wake up call I needed. Even as a child in elementary school, I would have a miniature meltdown when I got a bad grade or if a friend was mean to me that day. As an adult, I got better at hiding these emotional upheavals and intense reactions to the world around me, but they never really went away with my maturity like I had hoped. I took to heart every disheartening news article I read and every crappy thing that happened to me at work or in school. I'd let it consume me, because I was never told to live life any other way or that controlling my reactions was even remotely possible; I thought it was just a permanent part of my personality. I always knew that it was more of a vice than a virtue, but I felt like I couldn't fully control it.

		<review-text>The gist of SAONGAF revolves around Alan Watts’ concept of the ‘backwards law,’ (also called the law of reverse effort) found in his book “The Wisdom of Insecurity,” which states that wanting a positive experience is a negative experience, and accepting a negative experience is a positive experience. Watts’ says that “when you try to stay on the surface of the water, you sink, but when you try to sink, you float.” Mason translates this to mean that the more we pursue something, the less satisfied we become in our lives because it reinforces what is lacking. This law runs counter to the general messages bombarded at us that the key to a good life is more of everything, since giving a f*ck about a lot of stuff is good for business.

But caring about too many things is bad for you, and results in a life of superficial chasing and attachment. How do we reconcile this? Mason states here that “the key to a good life is not giving a f*ck about more; it’s giving a f*ck about less, giving a f*ck about what’s only what is true and immediate and important.”

The rest of the book provides a framework for how to do this. He starts by summarising the life of the Buddha, which tries to instill in us that suffering is a normal part of life and that it’s not all puppy dogs and ice cream. Instead of diving into the eastern religion in detail, which I suspect would have made most people put the book down, he creates a funny super hero called “Disappointment Panda” who he envisions going door-to-door letting people know what the real deal is, with such advice as “sure, making a lot of money makes you feel good, but it won’t make your kids love you.” The point here is that you should embrace the struggle, realize that life is painful, pick your battles, and start solving the right problems in order to get the most out of life.

Mason then outlines five concepts he thinks are important to adopt. At this point the book becomes more or less entertaining filler comprised of psychological studies and personal stories. First, you can’t choose what happens to you, but you can choose how you respond to what life throws at you (don’t be a victim). Second, realize you and everyone else are wrong about what they believe, so keep an open mind to learning new things. Third, embrace failure and realize pain is part of the process, and in the end, you actually won’t mind those parts of your life in hindsight. Fourth, know that it’s ok to say no, to reject things and set boundaries for what you will and won’t accept. Fifth and finally, embrace the fact you are going to die someday and come to terms with it. This perspective should allow you to choose your values more freely.

I felt at times I was reading a summary of many books any curious person would start coming across as they blossomed from a young grasshopper to a full-fledged ninja; Herman Hesse’s “Siddhartha”, Alan Watts’ “The Book”, Scott Peck’s “A Road Less Travelled”, etc. I give credit for the ability to stuff a lot of wisdom into a workable, 200-page airport non-fiction book. Mason explains psychology fairly well and adapts it to his thesis in the style of Malcom Gladwell or Jonah Lehrer. He also makes the book personal, bearing his soul as he adapts his own personal life lessons into the messages he is trying to convey. That isn’t an easy thing to do.

I did feel like the title was misleading and a bit of a bait-and-switch, surely done for marketing purposes. I can appreciate that the average attention span of someone feels like a nanosecond these days and the need to attach a popular meme to get eyeballs on it is necessary, so I won’t give it too much flak for that. But under the hood, the message is much broader and complex than “not giving a f*ck.” I found it confusing at times to read and then reconcile how he kept bringing it back to “not giving a f*ck,” or “giving too much of a f*ck,” or something in between. The spirit of the original meme and the thrust of this book to me are dissimilar, although he is cleaver in using this popular phrase to glue his points together.

This book is also hardly “generation-defining” as the back cover suggests. How could it be given the underlying source material that drives his thesis? Mason has recycled a lot of great wisdom and repackaged it in an entertaining way. But let’s not call anything here original because of the title he’s attached it to. For example, I really hope this book isn’t the first time you’re hearing about how Facebook and Instagram are making us miserable by only allowing us to see the best of everyone and comparing it to the worst of ourselves.

Overall this book was a refreshing reminder of what we should be thinking about when we make our life choices. If nothing else, go to a bookstore, sit down in a chair and read the first two chapters, which made me laugh out loud. And take the title with a grain of salt, he’s saying a lot more than what it suggests.</review-text>

		<review-text>He is an entertaining writer, but lacks perspective. This isn't surprising, since he was maybe 30 years old when he wrote this book. His &quot;expertise&quot; comes from blogging and traveling the world on his parents' dime. If you look through his blog you can also see that he has had little experience in long-term relationships, and that he has a very immature view of India (which makes me suspect his perspective on travel to other places).

Life is suffering, but you can suffer in a way to HELP yourself. This isn't just a self-help book, only YOU can help yourself.

I'll share the most interesting insights here:

1. &quot;It's worth remembering that for any change to happen in your life, you must be wrong about something. If you're sitting there, miserable day after day, then that means you're already wrong about something in your life.&quot;

2. Russians value honesty and are blunt because being direct, even if impolite, increases trust.

3. &quot;True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving.&quot;</review-text>

Aside from that note. I have read over 30 self help books due to my previous employment in the Behavioral Health Field.
This is one of the best books that I have read about mind setting. If you can get past the language their is a lot of helpful and useful information in each chapter. Although I do believe that some of the main points could have been made without the language, I did not write the book.

The main point however is made. You have a limited amount of time here on Earth. So stop getting so caught up in the little things that do not matter and focus your care and attention on those things that do.</review-text>

		<review-text>The subtle art of not giving is a refreshing book that gives the reader an unconventional view of life and all of its problems. Whereas most self-help books tell you to focus on the positive, this book takes a different approach and is based on the premise that we learn so much more from failure and misery. Pain, failure, and problems are a necessity if we want to grow as a person.

The subtle art of not giving teaches you about priorities and values. It's so easy to get caught up in overvaluing trivial things that are superficial and don't give true value. In many respects, a capitalist consumerist society stimulates us to overvalue certain things that in the end don't contribute all that much to one's happiness. It's okay to not give a.f about certain things. This will only make the f's you DO give to the more important things in life, more meaningful.

Most non-fiction books are all about teaching a certain topic and in this sense can be a bit dry. Manson, however, mixes his philosophical and psychological lessons with excellent story-telling that makes this book easy and pleasant to read. The stories in the book make it more entertaining and also put the author's ideas in a real-life setting, inviting you to think about your own values in life.

In short, the subtle art of not giving is entertaining, eye-opening, refreshing, and inspiring. One of the best books I've read over the past year!</review-text>

That being said, it really was not for me. I read the first few chapters before giving it up and deciding that I could not connect with the author's message the way that apparently many have. I found the writing too simplistic, and often times felt like I was listening to a motivational speech from a frat boy (too little depth and too much profanity).

		<review-text>This book is one for the intellectually honest individuals. Mark offers tremendous insights into the paradox of the different paradigms in which most self help addresses, but he focuses on the notion of seeing the world as it is and not so much about seeing the world in a way you'd like to see it. Yes the world is a beautiful place, but it also has its guts and horrors and if you choose to not accept that about life, it is only a matter of time until your throat will be slit. (Not literally.) But ultimately this book is a different approach to self help that I myself have fallen trap to in some areas, but it is one of those books that shows you the blind spots that you cannot see when you are so focused on attaining a certain goal of &quot;success.&quot;</review-text>

I have flown into war and have transported my nations bravest into combat and then hauled the bodies of those who gave their all out of the war zone. I've watched my beautiful wife give birth to two amazing kids. My generation, the millennials, are so entitled that they forget the real priority of life.

		<review-text>One of the best things this book did for me was give me a mirror to examine against.

It showed how I was contributing to my own unhappiness.
It taught me that fault and responsibility are two different thing
Yes I was not at fault for everything but I was responsible for everything. I wasn't taking responsibility which was &quot;tilting&quot; me.
It made me realize what an entitlement little bitch I was.
I expected the world to be &quot;just right&quot; for me and the fact of the matter is I don't have a right nor the means to make that claim.
and that's why I love this book.</review-text>

		<review-text>A very good book. Mr. Manson presents examples that remind us of people we all know (even of ourselves)! Then he turns our first thoughts about these folks upside-down. There is so much to think about.

The reviews that complain about the author cussing and using the F-Word are ridiculous. Read the words. Ignore the occasional F-Word. Does one word in a book make entire message wrong? This is how some people emphasize thoughts -- get over it. The title is an attention getter.

I am retired after a successful career. I have had a partner in life for thirty years. I am happy. I am happier after reading this book.

He does not give you the answers just a way to ask the questions. What fun is solving the problem of life if you get the answers! I am going to seriously consider Mr. Mansons' ideas. Thanks for making me think about what to do next.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is fantastic. Throw out all your conventional self-help/personal development manuals, and just read this! Not only is it not formulaic or boring, it's totally counterintuitive, irreverent, and cuts to the chase. It makes sense of so many concepts, issues, and experiences that the conventional &quot;wisdom&quot; gets wrong. It's honest, concise, and funny as hell! At the same time, it's profound without being academic. It made me really stop and rethink all my assumptions and conditioning. If you're looking for a book that will actually help change your life, this is it. If you're seeking a genuine, meaningful gift for a loved one, I recommend this book.</review-text>

		<review-text>I was skeptical about this book at first. I've always been a positive mentality type of guy. Look at the brighter side of all things, even dark. I enjoy Tony Robbins and his energy, and countless others who preach and breathe gratefulness and jubilation. So to no surprise, I actually did not enjoy the book at first. Manson goes on a rant on how being happy is a facade, that it's not a problem to dwell on the bad. I first I was taken aback and thought of not reading the rest, but I pushed on, and glad I did. He ends up detailing how we must accept the bad, and use it to make us stronger, not just ignore it. Appreciate the struggle, it breeds determination for better. This book, without a doubt, is on my top 5 recommendations to anyone. It teaches you to become grateful, accept the bad, but learn from it. Focus on the things that make you happy, but don't shut out the crap in our lives, learn how to turn it into less crap, because there will always be crap, just matters on how we deal with it.</review-text>

		<review-text>the book contains some useful advice, I'd say 40-50% is good content. It does ramble a bit but well worth it.

		<review-text>This book certainly isn't like anything else I have read. The author presents a realistic, if not a dark look at cold reality, Example: Many people think they are special, but in reality most people are simply average. He then explains that if everyone were special, then being special would become the new average as the average would rise to the that level.
The text is quite predictably full of profanity, which should not offend anybody who goes as far as to pick up the book with the obvious cover. If you would like to see a point of view on mankind what most other books never talk about, give this book a try.</review-text>

		<review-text>While my age and upbringing dictate that I be uncomfortable with the language in the book; I understand the novelty of it's use and how that novelty can be attractive to potential readers. But, this book has real substance hiding beneath the expletives. I almost gave up on it mid-way through, because I found the &quot;offensive&quot; language to be used so gratuitously that it seemed un-necessarily childish at times. But the philosophical insights came through in a big way for me as the ideas of the book coalesced.

The premise that spoke to me the most powerfully was; that everyone, no matter what the particulars of their life, has problems and will always have problems. And the key to a happier and more fulfilling life is not to attempt to create a problem free existence; but to orient your life in a way as to choose better problems; problems that you are capable of handling with less anxiety and stress. Sounds awfully simple, but I sure never thought of it !!!

Bottom line; If you can deal with the immature language, this book has solid wisdom for life purpose and direction.</review-text>

		<review-text>I divide this book into three parts: humor, self reflection, and letting go. Amidst all the humorous and well-placed f-bombs are undertones of Buddhism and deeper life lessons.

A decent read and if you don't get anything out of it the title at least makes for a great conversation piece.</review-text>

If his version of happiness depends on us all being self-service asses then I'm not interested in his version of happiness. Save your money, here's the gist of it... grab what you want, forget how it makes anyone around you feel, sue when you want, have a beer and move on.

		<review-text>I enjoyed this book so very much. It’s a no nonsense, tell it to you how it is book. From the title you can presume that there are swear words in it and it makes it all that much more entertaining. I felt so at home while hearing this book. It was like I’d come across a kindred spirit.

The author comes to a few conclusions that really rang home with me. Most, if not all, conclusions are drawn from his life adventures/experiences. I loved that he didn't try to force feed me life decisions that ‘should be made’. He would explain what happened to him, how he came to that conclusion and why it would be beneficial to me to try and come to that same conclusion. At the end of the day, he says he’s no life coach. He’s just a guy who gave everything up to write and he’s lucky enough to have earned a living doing it.

I can safely say that I want to read more books by this author. I’ve read one book and I’m officially intrigued. The writing was very good and it was a very relaxing book to get into (please consider that I listened to the audio book).</review-text>

It is not bad. I took it up because I thought my self needed some help, but horrors, not self-help.

But it is not going to change my life. Makes you think. A bit. You too will die. And nothing matters.

But I already knew THAT. Convince the physiological process that drives my anxiety that, and we have a winner. Close, but so far away.</review-text>

		<review-text>Most of the points in this book are not new, you have heard about them before, but this book will make you accept those points.

This is the best book about finding happiness.
This book will change your life and the challenge is to spread this idea to the people around you; or better to make them to read the book themselves.</review-text>

		<review-text>The energy that Manson displays throughout the book kept me reading. Insightful, humorous and filled with plenty of details to make one think about their own set of values. While I get that he is trying to refute the notion behind positivity being healing and helpful, ironically this book is one that incites the reader to positively choose what to give a f*** about. Well played! A thought Manson shared that stuck out for me was his statement that we should not try to be special or unique. Of course not. We already are! Human beings are quite amazing!

Mark's book resonates in reminding me of what I've learned through therapy, books and life experiences. If you've never journeyed into therapy then this will be new to you. If you've done therapy work this will be a good refresher in a cut-the-crap way. This is truth telling with no sugar on top that makes life's roller coaster a little less jerky. It is succinct, thought provoking and laugh inducing. He takes sound advice, wraps it in humor and serves up f***worthy information.

		<review-text>I'd like to start by saying, this book is for everyone. Why? Because everyone experiences anger, anxiety, depression, and worrying. Mark Manson does an outstanding job of explaining how not giving a f*** about anything is wrong and he redirects you on what values to give a f*** about. Utilizing examples instead of broad statements, he shows you how many of our feelings above are brought on by giving a f*** about the wrong values in life and not addressing our personally unique negative traits. Most self-improvement books try to convince you to be happy at all times and accept all things as they are. Manson address how it's not realistic and how to go about situations as a 21st century adult. This book is a must read for women and men that have open minds and are willing to drop their ego for a minute, to read a book, about changing where they give a f*** and what really matters in life.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is an incredible book! It is truly a counter-intuitive approach to living a good life--but sometimes the counter-intuitive approach is the solution. Basically, embracing positivity can sometimes be negative, and embracing negativity can be positive. For example, &quot;happiness comes from solving problems&quot;. He really strikes the fundamentals of living a good life by focusing on choosing the right values--ones that you can intrinsically control and that are good values to have, such as honesty. Manson distinguishes between &quot;fault&quot; and &quot;responsibility&quot;, which makes taking responsibility seem easier and empowering. He includes personal anecdotes that would ordinarily seem embarrassing, but they are raw and transformative experiences that allow growth. I laughed and cried in this &quot;self-help&quot; book. It made me feel lighter. Incredible wisdom for a 33-year-old. Please read it.</review-text>

		<review-text>What a wonderful find! Mark introduced a new paradigm to me contrary to the way I viewed the life experiences &amp; how I understood what motivates behaviors. He further gave explanations that felt right to me about life situations that I did not understand; myths I accepted as true. I found validation for concepts that I intuitively felt to be true but needed someone to reinforce with a logical narrative. I was so impressed with the teachings of the author that I had to keep looking at his picture &amp; marveling at his wisdom for such an apparently young man.

But throughout some parts of the book, I felt like some profanity were thrown in there just to be in there. Some were unnecessary and tried to bring attention to areas that weren't attention-worthy. Some parts felt forceful, such as sentences written in a way as an attempt to be clever. I thought the book gets increasingly better in the later chapters. The lessons are more profound and his personal stories made it more relatable.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is fabulous! I am not a reader but could not put it down- had me giggling outloud... maybe not the best book for a company mastermind group, as it can be a little too much for some people- but, it is spot on about so much in life.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is one for the intellectually honest individuals. Mark offers tremendous insights into the paradox of the different paradigms in which most self help addresses, but he focuses on the notion of seeing the world as it is and not so much about seeing the world in a way you'd like to see it. Yes the world is a beautiful place, but it also has its guts and horrors and if you choose to not accept that about life, it is only a matter of time until your throat will be slit. (Not literally.) But ultimately this book is a different approach to self help that I myself have fallen trap to in some areas, but it is one of those books that shows you the blind spots that you cannot see when you are so focused on attaining a certain goal of &quot;success.&quot;</review-text>

		<review-text>While the title is provocative, the contents are not. The author argues that getting rid of entitlement and other false beliefs will help in getting rid of multiple life miseries. Some chapters are longer than necessary. But quite easy and great read in parts.</review-text>

		<review-text>Reading this book made me think about the consequences of hyperaffluence and how many of the self-perceived problems we encounter every day could be partially solved if put into the context of need. The author makes a good point by drawing a line between the amount of exposure we are under and how this becomes in itself a need.</review-text>

		<review-text>Don’t mind the flood of F-bombs in the first two chapters...I almost quit after starting it, but it gets more reasonable. Very conversational voice and easy to read quickly. I reccomend this book for ANYONE searching for more meaning in their life at any level. I wouldn’t reccomend it for anyone suffering from severe depression, as this book does not sugar coat any realities and can be discouraging at times to digest.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is completely subjective and almost not at all objective. It does offer good points, but I would not say good advice because none of the points are valid.

		<review-text>This is the brutal honesty that I respect, appreciate and needed. I think more people need this approach and reality check. I'm only half way through the book and I already feel a weight lifted off of my shoulders. I feel like it validates some of my already existing beliefs, provides me with new outlooks and insight and quite honestly is putting me back in my place. It's been humbling and I appreciate it. This is exactly what I needed and it's quite refreshing!</review-text>

		<review-text>Good premise of the book - pick your battles, choose your struggles, and embrace the journey of life and the problems that come along with it. I really enjoyed the first half of the book. The second half really dragged for me. The gratuitous language detracted from the book, the random (very long winded) stories that didn't seem to relate to anything else made my mind wander, and the premise being beaten into you over and over bored me. I think there was a good message, but it could have been written in a 3 part blog series, not an entire book.</review-text>

		<review-text>This author had the guts to say what so many think. It's a good read but in the end it's another self help book without a solution.

Well thought out

		<review-text>“The desire to avoid rejection at all costs, to avoid confrontation and conflict, the desire to attempt to accept everything equally and to make everything cohere and harmonize, is a deep and subtle form of entitlement.”

		<review-text>This guy’s voice and prose are so unendingly cringe inducing. It’s like having a college sophomore frat boy tell you how to be happy... and we all know how smart 20 year olds are. Not to mention their writing skills. Chock full of painfully predictable analogies and metaphors. This guy read “Fight Club”, had someone once drunkenly explain a bit of the misogynist Bukowski to him and thought, “These guys are awesome! And I can do that too!” To use his favorite word: f*** this guy and his terrible writing.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book explains how you can practice stoicism in your daily life. It is a handbook on finding fulfillment, accepting pain, overcoming failure, and facing death.

Unfortunately it is written in a flippant style meant to appeal to edgy 20 somethings. Please don't let that stop you from reading this book. This book is filled with wisdom on living life well. Every page, every paragraph, every sentence is filled with practical and useful advice. This book distills the best out of several topics: Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, The Seven Habits, Ego is the Enemy, to name a few.

This is a must read if you are looking for valuable life advice.</review-text>

		<review-text>Don't give up on this too early. The last few chapters are easily its strongest.

		<review-text>I couldn't put this book down. I can't decide if it struck a nerve or sparked a fire in me. The stories resonated and made you wonder how we get to this place of thinking happiness comes from external events and sources. Since I read this book I have started asking myself why I measure myself against certain things. I have started evaluating relationships and making better decisions on who I surround myself with and what is important to me. The part of the book that struck me the most was talking about the Saver and the victim. I am surrounded by so many people who need other people to meet their emotional needs and to be happy. Thanks Mark Manson!</review-text>

		<review-text>Typical self help fare.

		<review-text>Happiness is not the absence of problems; it's the act of making progress on a problem (or several) you care about. Which is to say, pick your problems (&quot;f***s given&quot;) wisely, cultivate beginners mind (accept that you're always at least a little bit wrong), and fail your forward (experiment, get feedback, and rinse and repeat).

The above themes, as you can already see are not novel. However, Mark Manson does an excellent job of packaging them into an entertaining (and yes, vulgar and funny) narrative.</review-text>

		<review-text>I really liked Mark Manson's approach and view of life, death, and everything in between. I think I have fallen into the fixer of other people role in the past, and it was very eye-opening to have this view of entitlement (a word I generally dislike) as both victim and fixer.

The idea that we choose what problems we care about and that shapes our values was enlightening. Definitely a lot of food for thought here.</review-text>

		<review-text>It's very rare that I learn so much from one book. Mark Manson gives really valuable mental frameworks to use in your own daily life with a strong focus on controlling how you perceive things, people, and circumstances. One of the greatest thoughts in this book was &quot;What are you willing to suffer for?&quot; I've read the most highly rated life design books out there and I've NEVER heard it so eloquently stated. Mind was blown. I've read innumerable books on happiness and purpose in life. This book would rank right up there with the very best. Highly recommended.</review-text>

		<review-text>Terrible book. The author even admits in the middle of the book that he cannot teach you how to do what the book is named after. He uses a clever Yoda phrase (misquoted at that) to explain that to learn how to not give a **** is something that cannot be taught. I also found his description of a girl he met at a party weird where he decided to describe her with her race, &quot;pretty asian girl&quot; this would seem normal if he was naming the racial descriptions of his ex girlfriend, his stalker and wife, but he doesn't, just this one person. It's quite odd. Also, his part about we spend our lives being wrong, and as we age we get less wrong, seems... well... wrong to me. It is ageist and I know lots of children who are incredibly wise and I know lots of old people who are willfully ignorant. Furthermore for anyone who has survived trauma or abuse, learning to trust yourself is important, his emphasis on not trusting yourself and second guessing whether you are right doesn't seem helpful. The way he talks about sex and relationships seems kind of predatory and creepy to me, there is a level of objectifying women in his book that I don't really enjoy. If you've read his blog you may have come upon his article about &quot;the effects of foreign women&quot;, honestly, after learning more about him and reading his book, this self help guru goes on my creepy list, and so does his book. Furthermore, there are some segments that feel as though he added just to fill space, where he starts to randomly describe how to deal with a relationship if one person cheats, his background is in relationship and dating advice, and so it seemed like he needed to fill an extra 100 pages, so he just plopped some excerpts from his relationship research into this book. Not very well written, and seems to be written for white middle to upperclass privileged heterosexual primarily male audience.</review-text>

		<review-text>This might be one of the best self development books I've ever read. Despite the title, Manson doesn't advocate not caring.

		<review-text>Title definitely gets your attention, if you can get past the language some good points are made along the way. Was hoping the last chapter on how facing death can help us live better would tie up these ideas and give some lasting insights to chew on but the tone of the chapter seemed to come from a different book and just sort of ended. The author may not yet have the philosophical depth to tackle such a big question.</review-text>

		<review-text>Mark Manson, star blogger and (from what I can tell from his list of previously published books) semi-reformed pickup artist, offers us this brief volume of profanity-ridden self-help advice, which can more or less be distilled into the axiom: Life is short and your emotional bandwith is limited, so spend both wisely.

As far as it goes, that's good - if obvious - advice. Manson expands in chapters on the value of failure and suffering, the importance of saying no and of realizing that you're not exceptional, and why happiness as an expectation is kind of a mindgame. (That last was my favorite, as it not only matches a deeply held personal belief of mine but came with the marvelous metaphor of the Disappointment Panda.) So basically Maron's offering Buddhism by way of Fight Club's &quot;You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake&quot; and Kirk from Star Trek V's &quot;{Pain and guilt are} the things we carry with us, the things that make us who we are. If we lose them, we lose ourselves.&quot;

While the message itself is decent (if boilerplate), your enjoyment of this book will probably depend on how much you end up wanting to shoot the messenger. Manson, who's indubitably an entertaining writer, frequently comes off as privileged and smug, particularly in his semi-contrite humble-brags about the number of women he banged during his globe-trotting days, and I'm fairly certain the only psychology he really understands is of the pop variety. Still, the value of self-help books is in their beating you over the head with things you should already know but have either forgotten or chosen to ignore, and judged thusly Manson's Art is a wonderfully unsubtle reminder of why it's important to limit the f***s you give.</review-text>

		<review-text>I read Marc's blog and appreciate his no nonsense, counterintuitive and entertaining style. This book delivers more of the same. While it's a bit of a rehash of many of the topics and themes from his blog, it's sufficiently different to make it worth the read. Also, the concepts are expanded and woven together in a way that made a real impact on my thinking and life. A solid effort that's enjoyable and practical. Bravo Mark.</review-text>

		<review-text>I have to agree with reviews that criticize this book for not really going into the depth. The book does lack that 'something' needed for a convincing argument. This isn't a self-help book, nor was I looking for one. I just picked up this book as a curiosity to find out what kind of angle the author would take with a relatively interesting title.
The book has its moments. Some thoughts and statements are well stated in textually satisfying fashion. Also, the book does a good job of verifying things that many are already aware of. It organizes those thoughts for you and lays it down in words in a bold, punchy way. Therefore, I can see why some people would be moved by those emotions and end up liking the book so much.
In summary, it feels more like a well written diary of a once troubled soul. However, if you are really looking to find out what the title of the book suggests, you will not be truly convinced.</review-text>

		<review-text>You have never read a self-help book like this. It is so funny, and good advice as well. It is funny because the author writes in such a down to earth, crass style, with expletives saturating the book. First quarter of the book made me laugh out loud quite a few times. Then it starts to get more serious and redundant and a bit more tedious. But generally very refreshing in it's originality.

I wish I knew why &quot;The Disappointment Panda&quot; has a &quot;T&quot; (instead of a &quot;D&quot;) on his shirt (p.27). What is that supposed to stand for? T-shirt? Whatever.

		<review-text>The book turns your guts inside out. There are lots of points that make you feel indignant, yet you can't help but agree. The name of the book is a little bit &quot;misleading&quot;. Before reading it I was expecting like to find some advices of how to stop stressing out and hoping to find excuses for why I did not do some things in my life. On the contrary, the book gives you a cold shower explaining why you should take control and responsibility. Everyone will find something important in this book.</review-text>

		<review-text>Look, there are going to be few surprises in this book, but the author does a nice job of laying out the landscape, including personal stories and ending on, what I believe to be the central theme, how our acceptance of death frees us from our self-imposed limitations (I am over-simplifying).

		<review-text>such a great book. mark is a wonderful writer. i have been following his blog for about three years now and to date he hasn't written anything i don't agree with. if you need any further convincing check out markmanson.net and read his free archive, it is full of incite and blog post gems. also id like to note that he is a genuine person and has replied to my emails and given me personal advice. how often do you get to exchange emails with a best seller? seriously can't say enough good things about his writing or his character.</review-text>

		<review-text>While several things that Mark says should be intuitively obvious to a reasonably smart person, the way he phrases them and breaks them down resonated very clearly with me. I was at a point in my life where I was second guessing a life-changing decision when I realized that what I had actually done was a step in the right direction. I had stopped giving a %#&amp;# about things that did not matter. I also realized that several of the people who had held me back had not held me back...I had allowed them to hold me back thanks to my own insecurities. A realization is better late than never!</review-text>

		<review-text>For those of us who are trying to live life to the best of our ability's Mark Manson gives us a toolbox to use. His way of explaining the benefits of being able to get through the BS to what really matters is like talking to an old friend. He is very honest about his own life which makes his writings funny, thought provoking and reflective.

		<review-text>While this book might not be life changing for many of its readers it will be for some. And that's all that matters. For me it was. It was in the most illuminating and calming way possible.

Your work has been deeply meaningful to me.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is exactly what I needed. I have read many self help books but never felt any of them addressed what my issues were. Then I read this book and I gained the proper perspective of how to deal with the various issues that were wearing me down. It's very counterintuitive to many self help books and that is what I loved about this book.
If you have an issue with the four letter word in the title and are avoiding the book because of it, you are doing yourself a disservice. The first chapter has heavy usage of the word, but after that the book has the feel of speaking with a good friend and the use &quot;the word&quot; drops way off.</review-text>

		<review-text>Lots and lots of great takeaways from this book.

Will you have heard some of it before? Sure, but the ideas are presented very clearly and concisely here, with lots of humor and memorable stories thrown into the mix.

To me, the most important message in the book is the idea that pursuing the negative is a positive, that life sometimes sucks, and that you need to embrace the suck. Our expectations that our lives be all happy and perfect all the time are what leads to disappointment and frustration.

Again, something most people have probably heard before, but Mark did a great job of driving it home.</review-text>

		<review-text>Amazon suggested I pick this book up, based on some things in my cart. This is how I found one of the most important books I've read as an adult. I've dealt with anxiety the majority of my life. In retrospect, I've more or less mastered the art of playing it safe. As a result, I've never really experienced anything that resembles true satisfaction. Reading this book not only brought this to my attention, but gave me info on what to do about it. This book may rub you the wrong way, figuratively slap you in the face or any point in between. It's a wake up call for those constantly chasing happiness, approval, and value externally.</review-text>

		<review-text>There are tiny nuggets of wisdom lost in a sea of blithering nonsense. The lack of any substantial education in psychology becomes apparent quickly. As if that is not bad enough, the author often presents issues as black and white. According to Manson in there are two kinds of people, those who think they are deserving and those who do not. That is it. No spectrum here.

He also gifts people with thoughts he could not possibly know, makes outrageous generalizations, inadvertently outs himself as a misogynist, and uses way too much profanity at the beginning of the book. Instead of seeing this overdose of profanity as cool, I began to see Manson as someone who is still suffering from a case of teenage rebellion.

Fortunately the overdose of profanity slows to an acceptable amount as the book goes on. Unfortunately he knowledge of psychology becomes more and more obvious.</review-text>

		<review-text>Felt like I was buying a self help book, which technically it is... but he goes about it in a completely different way. His perspective on tough issues is nothing I've seen. Mark doesn't coddle you, he's blunt and some truths are hard to swallow. Instead of trying to change me into some peaceful yogi monk he showed me a different way of thinking that I can actually use and still be ME, just a better version of myself. I definitely recommend</review-text>

Nothing wrong with a new and entertaining way to sermonize some ancient and healthy ideals. Probably best enjoyed by those who are a little more easy-going.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book was awful. I dreaded reading it. It was a fast read. The beginning started out well and seemed interesting, but a few chapters in, you realize that this book isn't really going anywhere. It's superficial and sort of mindless. Just mindless drivel. The beginning part of the book was full of F-words, so many that they seemed over-the-top and out of place. The end of the book (the part about sitting near the cliff) was just cheesy. The author seems to lack any intellectual depth. The book might've had some good points but the author doesn't know how to convey them well or research them well; there was no depth. Seems like one of those pop-psychology books. This book might be appropriate for a teenager, but probably not an adult-level book. I'd skip it. Felt so lame reading it (lamer and lamer the more I read).</review-text>

		<review-text>This is great for beginners, particularity if you're not a strong reader. Anyone out there ever have to write a &quot;Life Philosophy&quot; senior-year in high school? This is Mark Manson's. Overall it's not bad, and got some solid coping-concepts to consider if not adopt. Hefty dollop of Buddhism mixed in. Entertaining and illuminating at first, the text devolves into what you might get from a drunk/stoned, fiscally-conservative philosophy major at a party, particularly if he's trying to get in your pants. He started losing my trust with is his non-stop hammering of &quot;entitlements.&quot; Sure, here, he's speaking to an entitled mind-frame when dealing with &quot;life on life's terms,&quot; but Mark's use of it strongly resembles how Republicans vilify people in need. (I got the impression that Manson--an entrepreneur from a rich family--would also defund &quot;Meals on Wheels.&quot;) If you're over 40, or have already done some solid digging in the garden of meaning, you're probably not going to get much more than a few laughs out of this. If you've just started on your quest for answers, this isn't a bad place to begin.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book changed my life. I am not being cavalier or hyperbolic when I say it either. This book changed the way I think about everything. Suddenly, little things that previously paralyzed me, just washed over me. The pesky floor squeak stopped annoying me. The bad driver I’m stuck behind in traffic can’t spoil my mood. My work / life balance improved and I am much happier.

We only have so many F***s to give. Why waste them on the insignificant or menial things in life?

The best part for me was focusing on taking responsibility for everything that happens in ones life. We don't choose for stuff to happen to us, but we certainly can decide how we are going to respond and own the situation we are in.

		<review-text>If I had the choice, I'd give this four and a half stars. Very worthwhile ideas that are very worth reading. But the author does primarily if not exclusively use men as examples, and, perhaps once, he, denigrated a woman to make his point, referring to her as some old lady who will probably die in a diaper. Well, as a woman who isn't young, I found this someone offputting, not to mention, that many of us may die in diapers -- but this may be a digression. Overall, I loved this book.</review-text>

Over the years I found myself increasingly resentful of the way self-help authors focus on positivity and self-transformation.

Manson takes this aspect of human life head on. I can't speak to how accurately he's pinned down human psychology, but many of the things he wrote in this book resonated with me. He's also very funny.</review-text>

		<review-text>Not a verified purchase as this was bought by a friend. I feel this book only gives a perspective from someone who's lived a life nothing like any normal/average human has lived; even though the whole premise is we are all average. He talks about how to not care about love, religion or dedication to things and to basically be a communist. He says he traveled 55 countries but isn't even 35. I'm not quite sure how that relates to people who can't afford to get an apartment or feed their kids. It's a severely extended chapter into 200 pages with a ton of common stories you can read free online with curse words spattered throughout and him gloating how cool he was till he got real happy by not trying anymore. Doesn't seem like anything other than one persons very unclear opinion. Just repeating &quot;values and entitlement&quot; every sentence. Read it and judge for yourself but I feel anyone who has any real problems in life would find this book counter intuitive to helping; as the title says.</review-text>

		<review-text>Honesty is the best policy. Learn to be honest with yourself and let go of life's anchors.

		<review-text>Read. This. Book. Manson drops a world of $*** right between your thinkholes and you've going left to do but think about it.
I read it in one day and that's a lot. Normally I'm too lazy to even sit and follow words along a tablet screen on the weekend. This was a powerful and potent experience that you should sit back and force yourself to eat. (*Cue exploding man scene from Monty Python*) Besides, exploding afterwards is healthier than the cigarette you used to nail into your face.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is not a book about apathy, it's about figuring out and focusing on what truly matters, not to your friends, to your colleagues, or to your parents, but what matters to YOU. Once you've found that organizing principal you can strip away the rest. Like any work of practical philosophy, the essence sounds simple in the abstract, but it's far more difficult to apply to your actual life. Manson's tongue-in-cheek style and unwavering realism in the anecdotes and ideas presented were pitched just right do to disarm my self-help gag reflex. This book is a quick, engaging read and an important reminder to focus on what matters, to reject the crowd and to design the good life for yourself as only you can.</review-text>

If you haven't read a lot of self help books and don't mind some locker room style humor, there are a handful of good ideas in here. However, mark tends to ramble a lot and there are a lot of paragraphs that just do not logically connect to each other. I blame this on bad editing.</review-text>

		<review-text>I have very mixed feelings about this book. While I found a few interesting points, I found most of the book boring and repetitive. I had no issue with the profanity-laced text, but I found the book to be negative and a bit distressful.

I purchased the Audible version. I would listen in the car on the way to meetings and found myself feeling awful about society and the world after listening. I also found the tone of the narrator to be really annoying as well.

I purchased this book because it was listed as number 1 in the same category as Everything I Never Learned in School: A Guide to Success which I had just finished reading. I think I'll go back to the list and find another book!</review-text>

		<review-text>First book out of the many self help books I have started. It is definitely a must read. Manson shows a different tough love approach of life. Each section can be applied to anything and probably everyone. I will definitely be referencing back to this book and keep its values close to heart throughout my life</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is a great self-help book that breaks from the norm. Manson writes in an easy-to-read way and is talented introducing concepts that the reader can relate to. His real-life anecdotes also illustrate the concepts and points in his book well. What I liked about this book is that he's able to take deep self-help concepts and explain them to the reader in layman's terms without using unnecessary big words.</review-text>

		<review-text>Mark's best work yet. The book isn't really vulgar, only some chapters and that is fine. His points really do put perspective what you are doing right now, and to my biggest suprise some of my values that I thought were bad actually quite good.
Would recommend this to anyone, amazing thought-inspiring book which you cannot put down.</review-text>

		<review-text>By the title you might think that this is about being edgy and not caring about what others think about you- but its almost the complete opposite. He teaches about how in order to not care about the alot of things, we must care about some things. For example. If you care about the enviroment, then you must ignore the people who tell you to destroy it. Overall this is a must read book for anyone. Highly recommend it.</review-text>

		<review-text>Oh, darn it.… and it really is a great book with excellent observations/advice. It's just kind of interesting that the author chose this in-your-face title, after telling people to choose their battles wisely. This is a great read... and would've made great gifts… But you open the package, see the title, and wonder if any goodwill is intended....and it goes on the bottom of the pile.

		<review-text>I agree with Mark Manson's basic values underlying this book, and I find his style of writing extremely entertaining as well.

I did not give it 5 stars because I found the structure of the book all over the place with not much coherence and flow into it.

	<review id="2055">
		<review-text>The premise of this book is counterintuitive. Everybody focuses on their goals - climbing Everest, making a million dollars, dating supermodels, whatever. The author correctly points out that this is entirely the wrong way to look at your life. Instead, you should be focusing on what tasks/challenges you enjoy doing. Do you even enjoy climbing mountains? Do you enjoy long business meetings? Do you enjoy spending time with supermodels?

You cannot become a great musician if you do not enjoy practicing.

Most self-help books tell you to identify your goal and them power through the obstacles. The problem is that powering through the obstacles is what you spend your whole life doing. The traditional answer is that nobody enjoys challenges, they just want the payoff at the end. Maybe there is some truth to that, but this author looks at it from a different angle. Besides, if you enjoy the obstacles and challenges then it won't matter too much if you fail to achieve your goal.</review-text>

		<review-text>Recommend listening to or reading this book more than once to get all you can out of it. Wise words expressed with a sense of self-deprecating humor, just sharing his own fumbling journey and resilting insights to see if it might help us reclaim some peace of mind. Right on target for me. The audiobook rocks, great reader. But paperback book form is good too. Keep an open mind and get to it.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is getting too many positive reviews. It's perhaps a 3.5/5, so I will err on the side of stern judgment.

Manson's earlier work, Models, was more effective because of its more obvious set of objectives and guiding principles. The Subtle Art is a hash of various self-improvement ideas that is wanting for a central thesis. This book feels scattered and would require the reader to carefully reread on a regular basis to really draw out the summary points.

I enjoy Manson's writing, so I would still recommend this book to anyone who liked Models, but this book doesn't have a lot of merit on its own. The other book regarding F* giving that arrived on the market this year, by Sarah Knight, makes better use of humor and has a more comprehensive set of behaviors to work with.

Also, I would caution anyone who reads this book to be wary about how Manson uses the concept of 'entitlement.' By the end of the book it's just a poorly-argued rhetorical bat-to-the-face. It becomes something like liberal discourses on 'privilege,' where it's as catch-all term for any mindset you want to abuse. -Ryan Mease</review-text>

		<review-text>I've been reading a few of 'these' books recently. I really appreciated &quot;the Untethered Soul.&quot; I've been focusing on my journey inward -- why can't I seem to find satisfaction in the little things, why does it take a significant event to make me feel something. I feel overstimulated by the world and all the people and events I'm so arbitrarily 'connected' to. This book helped me understand that I'm too caught up in my head. Hopefully it pushes me to act, to inspire and motivate myself into more action. I loved the parts on victimhood chic (my entire news feed, all the time), romantic love, and taking responsibility for everything that happens to us: we aren't to blame, but we're still responsible for our choices, our reactions to events and how we allow them to affect us. The cursing in the beginning is definitely a bit cheesy, and sometimes he says thing you think you already know. Maybe it's just nice to hear them again from a guy who doesn't think he's more special than the next guy. It definitely showed me a practical definition of entitlement that gives me more to work with than some person in the comments section of some post online telling us we're all entitled. It made me realize that my values have been more than a little messed up in the past but that's aight, even good. Now I can choose and develop the values I really want. Maybe it won't change your life, but this book will make you think. Recommended to my friends.</review-text>

		<review-text>The book certainly provides a novel perspective at approaching life. However, much of it can be gleamed from commonly witnessed facebook memes.

		<review-text>I really hated this book. I forced myself to read the entire book to make sure there wasn’t something I was missing. Perhaps, it just want the book for me.

		<review-text>I had read Mark's blog before and really liked it. However, this book just isn't for me. Maybe I changed over the years but although I really like the realistic tough love that he writes with, there's just too much cynicism and pessimism for me. He does have some great points like you are always choosing and that there's power in choosing and victimhood in not choosing.

If you can't stomach typical personal development books, this might be for you.</review-text>

		<review-text>No-bullshit approach to self help. Nothing about your connection to the universe, or you are unique and special.

		<review-text>First don't read the first 20 pages.. the title is good but that doesn't mean the F word had to be used million times in the first 20 pages. It was almost like rambling. I decided to read it till the end and found the author makes good points but for my taste I felt they were presented in a too detailed way and it didn't stick easy in my mind.. but that is a subjective comment.. and that's my feedback.. it could have been more succinct and well written. Did it improve me and make me change to what the title claims.. may be by 10% I will try out few things mentioned in the book and see how it goes.</review-text>

		<review-text>Such an easy and fun read. Can give some really great introspection to anyone that is stuck in a rut at their current moment in life. Reinforces great ideas on how to move forward and not dwell on things.

My only critique of this book would be the title haha. It's a funny and great title, but the book is more about &quot;Choosing your battles&quot; and &quot;Picking your spots&quot; in life if you were to ask me. Mark is a terrific writer and this is a book you don't want to put down once you really get going.</review-text>

		<review-text>I've always been a fan of Mark. Now he's out with a really deep book. Its ideas are so powerful is it actually impossible to be fully absorbed and understood with just a first read.

		<review-text>The book touts itself as a different look at how to be better with little more urban flare. This assimilation of thoughts is no better than the self-help gurus. It is the same thing he rails against, just in a different form.

It is standard fair here. Don't be a Richard. Give a &quot;blank,&quot; but give the right one. You aren't special, but what about your legacy?

Cut and paste self-help, except &quot;cooler,&quot; which it isn't. I bought this book with pretty low expectations and even invested in the hardcover format before reading it. After getting about half way, I was checked out and understood this was just savvy marketing at this point more than a book set to make a mark on my life.

Also, as a believer in pagan gods, I checked out at the &quot;witty&quot; comment in the bad behavior section.

If you've read other books like this before, you aren't getting anything new. If this is your first venture into this self-help world, then you can invest in it with the caveat that you read other books to get what I'm saying about the similarity of it all. Otherwise, skip the book.</review-text>

		<review-text>Do you like it when people talk down to you like you're a child? If you do, then this book is for you!
There are some truly frightening non-truths presented in this drivel, I suggest if you do read it, you proceed with caution. It is a pseudo-philosophy designed from a Caucasian male perspective that admits his life by and large was bent around self gratification (but surprise! he is different now, and condemns that sort of stuff.)
The author casually refers to his life of drugs, partying and &quot;sleeping around&quot; (using women) as his &quot;years of reflection&quot; and until finally he decided to write a book on self help! He condemns everyone who is &quot;entitled&quot; yet exhibits the same faults. He goes on to say that &quot;nobody is special&quot;. People that &quot;are&quot; special (Steve Jobs etc.) are only great because they were &quot;psychopaths&quot; that wanted immortality. Also, he says: &quot;you shouldn't want to be rich&quot; (save that for the &quot;elite&quot; who can use it better) instead just be happy being poor and don't worry about leaving a legacy behind. With such a sad outlook on life, I thought the author might be hedonistic... but alas, he is opposite (even though he himself ditched college, partied, used women and left them) he tells us we should all have &quot;values&quot; (like having one partner) this of course now that he is married and has a wife that he undoubtedly expects to be &quot;virtuous&quot; and &quot;monogamous.&quot; This book is like some sort Orwellian informational pamphlet: &quot;You must not challenge the system. You must not dream. You must not think too highly of yourself. You must not try hard at anything.&quot;
There are better books out there. If you want a good book on this topic go to the source: Madonna, Andy Warhol, Salvador Dali... you know... people that actually don't/didn't care.</review-text>

		<review-text>The focus of this book, in many ways, mirrored Stephen Covey's &quot;7 Habits of Highly Effective People&quot; with different and more colorful language.

Several notes that I gained from this book included:
• The Do Something Principle
• Pain is a part of the process
• Commitment frees us
• And the ability to chose what to truly care about.

I would recommend this book to friends because of its focus, insight, and down to earth, coffee table approach of sharing wisdom. It was REAL which I enjoyed.</review-text>

		<review-text>I cant see how this book can help anyone to achieve anything.
Besides some good philosophical opinions and some ideas its total boring and with a negative frame. The worst thing is that there is nothing really to apply or to really &quot;learn&quot; . I hate &quot;over-complicated new social conditioning ideas, where you realize what is really going on, you see the matrix and really improve yourself.&quot; (The previous sentence its according to the style of this book. It had to be vague.)

Honestly i believe that the best and maybe only thing to read about Mark Manson is : The Life Purpose Guide&quot; which you can find on internet.Its totally applicable , WITH TOTAL CLARITY, short , straightforward to the point about what you want to do.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book was a very inspirational read, but not in regard to the typical &quot;highs&quot; you may get from reading self help books. It basically encourages you to embrace criticism and failure, face your own entitlements and insecurities, and even come to terms with one's own mortality. Having read a plethora of self help books myself, I'm happy to say that this is among my favorites. It definitely goes straight for the difficult questions and pulls no punches in the process, two things that a social life in America (where I live) these days severely seems to lack.

Although many of the ideas I had already learned from books and seminars, I really like the way he condenses and present his ideas. It's worth reading, I recommend it !

		<review-text>Great book, but then, I love Mark Manson in all his profane wisdom. This book is some real talk that a lot of people need to hear. I highly recommend Mark's blog too. A great writer, a basically good, flawed human like the rest of us who has flashes of awesome insight, and funny to boot. What's not to love? Oh, and I'm a good 10 years older than Mark, and supposedly wiser, but that's not the case. I've just had more experiences. Doesn't make me wiser. Get this book from this young-ish whippersnapper. You won't be disappointed. And if you are, well then, there's just no pleasing you, is there? ;)</review-text>

		<review-text>The truth is always hard to hear, and even harder to apply. I enjoyed the deep and &quot;in the face&quot; images in this book. I found it refreshing and relatable. Fear is always the thing that holds us back and is the thief of joy. Stripping away all of our self made exteriors and self image leaves us humble and naked and ready for change. If you have ever felt you are living a life that is not right for you, READ this book and feel free to change it. You have choices and you alone travel your own path- so YOU make it the one you feel good about, and a life of fulfillment and joy.</review-text>

		<review-text>A quick, easy listen on audio. I definitely wouldn't call it a &quot;generation-defining self-help guide,&quot; as it's described, but it was enjoyable enough. There were some interesting insights, particularly centered on the author's own journey — he credits his success, in some ways, to reaching a low point and only then feeling free (not giving an F) to make his own path toward success and happiness. It was about what I expected from the title and from what I knew of the author, who is a famous blogger: entertaining, occasionally thought-provoking, but not penetratingly deep.</review-text>

		<review-text>It's ok. Honestly I think it's more about lowering your standards than it is about achieving what you want. Don't expect much out of yourself and you will feel like a success. Not really impressed. I think this book would have made a bigger impact on me if the author had more credentials. Not really seeing why he would be credible on the topic except that he has a lot of followers on his blog. It was entertaining in a quick read sort of way. But that's all. Nothing thought provoking or life changing if this is what you are looking for.</review-text>

		<review-text>Really nothing revolutionary in this book, and I found it a little underwhelming as a whole. It does, however, provide a fresh perspective on things. We live in the era of positive thinking and meditation and good energy and affirmations etc.
All of these terms are so overused and have exhausted their meaning, and Manson flips the case on its head - what if you don't try to force a positive reaction to something you're just naturally designed to react negatively to? What if you adjust your sensitivity to things so that you can truly weed out what's important from what isn't? Simple, but compelling. I still recommend the book if you're tired of all the self-help, positive affirmation cha-cha that has flooded the market.</review-text>

		<review-text>I got about 1/4 of the way through this one and put it down.

I've never read Mark before and the customer reviews were all stellar, so I bought.

I hate giving bad reviews on things people work really hard on, but there needs to be an honest review here.

It would've saved me $12 by accurately depicting what this book is.

This is not some new spin on how self-help has been written about in the past.

It's full of stories the author presents about others which I got tired of reading.

I found myself sifting through these anecdotes trying to find the point Mark was trying to make.

Usually it was something like 'don't care what people think' or 'you're average just accept it'.

Which is fine, but just say that.

I found this disappointing, I wanted to hear the authors ideas as he is a really successful blogger in a tough niche.

But all the stories took the air out of this book for me, as I finally got around to Mark and his thoughts on the subject.

And the ideas that were shared were underwhelming, or my expectations were too high.

Either way, I didn't get a lot out of this one.

The theme of accepting what is and embracing struggle is fine, but it's presented in a way that's mildly depressing to read.

As with any self-help book, it will affect everyone differently, this is only my opinion.</review-text>

		<review-text>So, some of the advice is sound and logical but I have the hardest time trying to get past the blatant opinions made to sound as if they're facts and the unnecessary cussing. He uses the &quot;F&quot; word just to use it sometimes. It's hard to overlook. I'd like to focus on what advice he's giving but I have to eliminate too many &quot;F&quot; words to get to the point that it takes time and my full attention. I'm disappointed.

		<review-text>At least he is honest enough to say he is completely wrong...but that's ok (he's just slightly less wrong than he use to be and in the future he will be slightly less wrong than he was when he wrote this book). When an author tells you he's wrong then what is the point of continuing to listen?

I was listening to the audiobook and realized 1/2 way through that it is just fluff to make a buck (or a lot of bucks) from his blog. And it is what he cares about...great, sadly it is not what I care about. I think most 1 &amp; 2 star reviews are correct that this book is for young adults and that's great but again sadly I'm not a young adult either. Lots of good dime store psychology points but it really could be done in 1/2 the time with an actual workable plan instead of: Change the way you think &amp; good luck.</review-text>

		<review-text>Originally I bought this book for myself, took my time reading it and really enojoyed it. Soon after i bought a copy for my mother who has read it roughly twice by now, (picking out her favorite parts and rereading them). I've lent my copy out to at least 5 or 6 other family members who also really enjoyed it.

I don't read often, but when I do, it was this book and I loved it.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is fantastic. I first heard the audiobook and loved it so much I had to purchase a physical version. The name may leave you under the impression that the book is frivolous, but it is honestly one of the best self-help books that I've read in a long time. The author's style is engaging and relatable.

I now keep the hardcover copy on my coffee table and recommend it to anyone who visits my house!</review-text>

		<review-text>The first few times I read Mark Mansons blog, I enjoyed it. I laughed. His style and humor infused advice was a refreshing change. Then I found out he's a former PUA coach. And basically I saw it all in a different PUA style light and his writings all seemed more like a formulaic marketing scheme to me. The shallowness of his message showed through. His sweeping generalizations overshadowed what I once thought was clever. The book was not very impressive to me, but mostly I wanted to mention the PUA coach thing because not many people know that</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is just a rehashing of tons of other books and blog postings out there. He just uses harsh langauge in every sentence as a gimmick.

His view on current American culture is also nothing new. The impact of social media on our mental health, etc. is not news. His calling out of the white middle class is also just to provoke and has no relevance to the point he is making.

This entire book could be replaced with phrases like &quot;just roll with it&quot; or &quot;go with the flow&quot; or &quot;focus less on the trivial many and focus more on the vital few&quot;.

I'd recommend the book on Essentialisim which delivers these messages in a much more possitive way.</review-text>

		<review-text>I really enjoyed the first half of this book. He made some really interesting points and provided a new perspective on life. I found many of his concepts thought-provoking and insightful. However, it went off the rails for me in the second half. I don't mind swear words but the tone in general came across more aggressive than necessary. And then he spent a lot of time talking abut himself. It just seemed odd, like he was trying to justify to himself why he chose to settle down. I would've purchased the summary if I had seen that first!</review-text>

		<review-text>&quot;Look at me.

It doesn't take a genius to create a straw man (the big bad stupid self-help industry in his case) and set it ablaze. It seems like Manson is happy to think that ALL of those who've made a vocation of trying to help other folks find their way are just as self-interested, materialistic, and pessimistic as he is.</review-text>

		<review-text>A wonderful read that comes highly recommended. Mark equates challenges and problems faced by many adults today to the current cultural trends and adds a healthy amount of humor to keep things light. Don't be mistaken, this book will drive to the core in most folks, causing the readers to seriously question their own internal workings and responses to an ever-evolving society. I've read and re-read this book and continue to refer to the individual chapters when I'm facing a challenging problem or need to be reset in my thinking. This book drives home the point that problems in today's life are unavoidable, but HOW we choose to respond to the problems will serve as an internal feedback loop for personal growth through experience.</review-text>

		<review-text>I agree with the premise, but the cocky, profanity-laden rantings turned me off. Does the author own a thesaurus? I highly doubt it. I have heard it said that the constant use of profanity shows a lack of imagination. Surely Manson could have substituted the F-word, and all its many permutations, with something more original, from time to time. I’m not protesting the use of the F-word (obviously it was in the title and I bought the book on audible) it was the grating repition of it that made it impossible for me to continue listening. Perhaps, had I been reading it, I would have been able to continue with the book.</review-text>

		<review-text>I saw an interview with this guy on Marie Forleo website and was very intrigued. I checked out his website and amazed at all the insightful yet funny information. The book is the same way. He tells you exactly what you need to be told without sugatcoating it in powdery fluff, but still manages to throw in some sarcastic humor.

He backs up all his points with books and other academia. I will tell you that if you dont like curse words you may have a hard time getting through the book. I do not care for cursing, but the foul language doesnt bother me in this book because its not in everyline, its used very purposefully actually.

If you dont want to commit to the book, check out his website. Its very similar.</review-text>

		<review-text>About as good as it gets. This book nailed it in every respect.

	<review id="2435">
		<review-text>While the title of this book can seem crude or funny, it has surprising depth - as does the manuscript. This book indirectly describes an Aristotelian notion of a &quot;mean between extremes&quot; that we seem to be unconsciously striving for as the central drive in our lives - a drive that we are constantly trying to clarify and attend to, but one that is under assault, by distraction ... some stuff matters but we tend to give a f*ck about too much that just doesn't matter and the important stuff gets lost. I appreciate the levity provided by Manson's use of language and candor throughout that brings light to what could be too dark to get through. He models his message. This was enjoyable yet serious. It was thought-provoking yet comprehensible. It was bold yet delicate. This is a valuable contribution to the good life. It finds the mean.</review-text>

		<review-text>The book starts out fresh with promise and humor, and tackles some interesting points about entitlement. However, I felt that each chapter iterated the same point one too many times, and I was a little exhausted by the end. There was also a lot more about relationships than I had expected, and I felt that Mark belabored that section too much. The last chapter is potent and very well written, with a bit more emotion and conviction than the rest.</review-text>

		<review-text>Every life lesson you wish you got growing up, but probably didn't, reinforced with a no-BS, in-your-face directness and real life stories. No beating around the bush or intellectualizing here - Mark cuts to the truths about what it takes to THRIVE vs. merely survive in the world we've created and busts our illusions about it all. This should be required reading for the human race!</review-text>

		<review-text>I stumbled upon this book when I was looking for some inspiration. I had found various titles that promised to be inspiring and to motivate you on finding the meaning of life. I wanted none of those, and for one good reason: they felt forced and fake. I don't doubt that the people who wrote those books wrote them with good intentions for the most part, but I felt like they were too... 'cheesy'. I wanted something genuine that didn't try too hard at being deep and took itself too seriously and I can thankfully say that I found it in this book. As I said, don't be tricked by the title, it might sound too irreverent or childish even, but this book manages to be authentic, relatable and with deeper meaning, all by being funny at the same time. Can't recommend it enough.</review-text>

		<review-text>Mark Manson wrote a compelling story that was underpinned with one important truth: better values = better life.
Once you stop judging yourself and others based on unhelpful values, you can harness that to become a better person for yourself.

		<review-text>This one is straight off the Amazon best sellers list. Otherwise, I can't imagine searching for the book by its name. In fact, even Amazon search can't deal with the asterisk censorship and so the best you can get is &quot;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck&quot;. However, those disappointed by the censorship would be glad to know that the 4-letter word (and its extensions) appears in full glory throughout the book. I often question myself about the creative impact of using expletives but in this case, it is just a literary device, so you might as well replace it with whatever word stirs up your guts.

The theme of the book is pretty much summed up by its title. It is about focus, choosing what you care about, just doing it and not giving a damn about things that do little more than drain away life's sap. To that end, the message in the book is repetitive and contains tidbit of knowledge that I find myself sharing with acquaintances. Unfortunately, that doesn't quite make me a life guru for I admittedly fail to put my money where my mouth is, dissemination being much easier than treading the path by yourself. The book also doesn't consistently hit the witticism gong but its forthrightness is bound to strike a chord. 

Inevitably, preaching is true of any self-help book since it is all about self-realization and how one chooses to act up on it. To that effect, the book gets in to the stride right away with the story of Bukowski and his epitaph &quot;don't try&quot;. The final part about immortality projects, conceptual self and the need to leave a legacy is particularly poignant but then that would be a recommendation for another book than this one. Such anecdotes littered throughout the book add substance to what may otherwise be construed as preaching. Also, most of the words of wisdom are borne out of experience and hence easy to appreciate for their relevance.

I would recommend this book to a lot of people whom I feel are far too obsessed with life's vagaries. However, it is only out of the altruistic (certainly not buying the book for them) hope that it will help them take a much more positive outlook towards life. At the same time, I wouldn't say that the book has flipped a switch in my mind for I see much of what is mentioned in this book as common knowledge but for the fact that application of the same is an altogether different beast. Ultimately, the book is of utility to those who want to find some use of it.

At the end of the day, one should understand that the book isn't a gospel and simply a person's take on life based on his experiences. It leaves a lot to disagree with since it seems a lot of the metaphors were shoehorned in this book to fill up the pages. For instance, a section of the book can be equated to the oft-used phrase &quot;money doesn't bring happiness&quot;. This is easy to appreciate but at the same time a bit difficult to fathom when the entire world revolves around it and is undoubtedly a driving force behind the author's choice of career. Another instance is about failure bringing you back to where you started which is as true as you wish it to be for life doesn't remain in stasis while you fail. Similarly, despite the author's life struggles, his experiences are built up on his journey across countries which has been feasible on the strength of him being in the United States and having access to &quot;cheaper&quot; countries. Would these perspectives be true for someone struggling through life in a developing country and having lesser forms of escapism? Again, I believe not. The author chooses to harp on transient moments in life to put through a message. I often have thoughts running through my mind as I stare at the setting sun on the beach with the wind running through my hair and the waves receding after gracing my feet. While these picturesque moments fit well in to books and movies, the accompanying narrative doesn't translate much in to changing the humdrum of life. Of course, I could be as wrong about my take on life as much as the author is right, but such pessimism wouldn't find its way in to a book.  

This is not to say that there isn't much to take away from this book and find some positivity from it to apply to your life. The self-help industry wouldn't have been such a lucrative one if everyone knew what's best for them. At the same time, unless you have been living under a rock, you would have your own experiences and lessons from life that ought to have taught you a lot more, only if you chose to pay attention.</review-text>

		<review-text>I'm a big fan of Mark's blog. And I was really looking forward to enjoying this book. I didn't. It felt clunky and piecemeal. The uncouth contrarian trope grated after the first 40 pages. The chapters on values read like a collection of book reviews on more influential works. And the personal stories struggled to reach a meaningful emotional apex. There's no doubt in my mind Mark Manson is great writer with a razor keen intellect and a talent for crafting a persuasive argument. Unfortunately, none of those attributes show up strongly in this book. Hopefully his sophomore effort hits closer to the mark.</review-text>

	<review id="2558">
		<review-text>Within the first few pages the title of the book is contradicted by the author saying &quot;well, actually, you have to give a $#@&amp; about some things&quot; Okay. He then goes on to bash other teachings that practice affirmations, selfishly explains why he tells his wife she doesn't look good after she spent an hour getting ready, and then regurgitates all conventual wisdom that is found all across the self-help realm. Somehow, people walk away truly thinking this book is about not giving a $&amp;@#. It's baffling.

Manson states emphatically, &quot;Happy people don't need to stand in front of the mirror and tell themselves their happy.&quot; Let's think about that in regards to a different characteristic, like confidence. I'm sure everyone here has seen atleast one transformation from a timid, reserved, nervous person into a person of confidence and pride. For the majority, that does not just happen by deciding &quot;okay. F it. I'm confident now.&quot; No, it's a process which may involve journaling, therapy, or maybe even *gasp* being in front of a mirror at some point (if that works for the individual), visualizing ways in which you can be confident.

&quot;But confident people don't have to do that!&quot; I can hear all 5 star reviewers of this book retorting. It's not about what Mark Manson believes is the way to an improved you. It's about respecting the differences from other approaches and contributing or practicing something unique for your personal life situation that may be helpful to you.

Perhaps the most powerful was his description of the experience he had when on the Cape of Good Hope in Southern Africa. That alone earned two stars. But other than that there is little left.</review-text>

		<review-text>Wow. What a mess. It's nothing more than thinking out loud in a completely unorganized fashion. He makes sure to literally cover every angle of whatever he is trying to get to, in order for people to pick out the parts they relate to. I'll save you hours.... don't sweat the small stuff. There you go. Now you take away the message he was &quot;probably&quot; trying to get it. Its endless dribble of F-bombs for edginess and shock value, along with stories that don't really relate or go anywhere. If you go to a psychic and are like, OMG SHE TOTALLY KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT ME, well, then you'll love this. How this got published or has a following is beyond me. But I guess those looking for self help books will latch on to anything even remotely relate-able to their situation. I received this as a gift thinking I would be into it, but it reads like a bunch of high school sophomores all wrote parts separately, dropped all the pages when they were turning it in, and just stacked them back together and stapled them together.

But if I learned anything from this book, it's that I'm a loser for giving a f*ck about this book and that doesn't make me a loser, not giving a f*ck is important, but you shouldn't give a f*ck cause that's what loser do, unless that is what you give a f*ck about, then you're a winner.... see how ridiculous that is. Well, that's the book.</review-text>

		<review-text>So well written. This book will make you re-evaluate things in your life you maybe thought were great accomplishments or goals but may in fact be manifestations of warped values causing you to stay stuck in the same patterns of fear, lack of truly connecting with others and bad relationships. I definitely recommend.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is the truth you need to hear but might not want to. The world pushes you to continue to want more and more but the happiest people don't fall into this trap. I recommend this book to anyone who feels like they aren't good enough or want to find how to become more confident in who they are. Manson won't let you lie to yourself anymore and he pushes you to take the action needed in your life. I can't recommend it enough!</review-text>

		<review-text>The F word is actually two things, worrying and caring. Once the author establishes his point on over obsessing, over thinking, and other psychological issues we have and don't realize it, how things can change once we gain perspective.

		<review-text>Simply put, this is something you have to just read to experience. It made me cringe with self reflection at times. That is the real intention of this book. Give it a go if you are brave enough.</review-text>

		<review-text>Balanced and wise, with lots of common sense, honest and open, Mark Manson speaks to me and I understand. It makes me connect the dots, understand things about me and the others, helps me to figure out situations and emotions that I was struggling to figure out. Thank you, Mark Manson!</review-text>

		<review-text>I would say that you should read this book after reading other &quot;primary&quot; self help books like the 7 Habits or the Bible. This kinda of provides a concession for comparison and shouldn't be read as the primary source of self help. Great book though.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book was recommended by a friend of mine. I got the sample of it from Google and I should have just bought it on Google for an easier and faster refund.

This book frustrated me so much I was seeing red. The way the author went about writing this book basically felt like, &quot;your life sucks, you won't amount to anything no matter how much hard work you do, but that's ok&quot;. To me, that makes no sense, absolutely none. I pushed through to page 72 and I had to call it quits. Maybe I'll try and read it again in the future, but for now I'm putting it down. I really wish I knew why people liked this book.

I really don't recommend it for people who are depressed and have anxiety, this book may make things worse (it did for me).</review-text>

		<review-text>While I read in reception rooms,as well as at home, people inquire about the name.

		<review-text>I just finished reading this stirring, insightful, book. It came at just the right time in life for me. It has caused me to sit up and seriously rethink my values and how I measured my life and what that did to me. Thank you Mark Manson. This book made me think about my purpose and about what I thought were my beliefs. Few books have done this much for me this year, and I read every day. Keep an open mind, read the book and dance people. You'll be better off for it.</review-text>

		<review-text>Truly intelligent people do not have to use the vulger language chosen by this author. It leads one to wonder if ANY of his comments have any worthwhile value. Please Mr. Manson (and others like him), get a decent vocabulaly. I have but a GED and mine is superlative compared to yours. It can be done. We call one of our freedoms &quot;Free Speech&quot;, but any freedom can be abused and, when it does, takes freedom away from the freedom of others (as in, many wish to have the freedom NOT to see and deal with vulgarity, quite the conundrum...). NEVER even like seeing the cover of this book. Kids see it too.......i am sure will be attacked as immature on this, but really, who is immature if this is the language they use?</review-text>

		<review-text>I, too, regret wasting my money on this book. The constant use of profanity (how many times did he need to say &quot;f***&quot;....really?) was distracting and disturbing. Perhaps this is a book for generations younger than I who need potty humor, salacious references and the like to keep them interested. I tried to focus on the underlying message the author was attempting to convey, but it was weak. To be honest, I only made it one-third of the way through and gave up in frustration.</review-text>

		<review-text>Hey Fellow Kids! This is my first time cringing at a book..

		<review-text>I absolutely hated this book. It is written for an audience of mediocre to low intellect, written in a very offensive, clearly sexist, vulgar and racist language. There are no new ideas to take away - unless you have been a complete failure all your life. Not giving a F*? What he implies by that is simply prioritize what is important and what is not and do not waste your energy on things you cannot change. Duh.

		<review-text>This book irritated me. It has a lot of interesting ideas in it, but it's written by a bro, for bros. There's a lot of unnecessary vulgarity and dudery. For instance, when talking about how most of your dreams will probably never come true, he says something about how &quot;you'll never feel Jennifer Aniston's tits.&quot; Dude... seriously? He also shares a lot of &quot;findings&quot; and refers to some &quot;studies&quot; but doesn't back them up with any sources. Also, his hypothetical examples are often based on gender stereotypes-- a man trying to get a promotion, a woman trying to find a life partner. Yawn!</review-text>

		<review-text>First of all; the truth: I haven't read this book. The reviews submitted by all of you were extremely educational. As a youth, I read my share of &quot;self-help&quot; books. I don't bother anymore. Not because I have all the answers or lead a perfect, carefree life. None of us ever will.
It would be easy to say (as one reviewer suggested) that all millennials should read this book. But, let's be honest, those who might really benefit from a book like this (at least the helpful parts as many of you have described them) would never dream it might be helpful to them. Our president for example. However, I doubt he has the attention span to make it through the first sentence. Personal responsibility, ethics, and choosing your battles wisely are such foreign concepts to him (and his idiot followers), It would be a waste of time.
I learned the truly important concepts in my life from my parents. I didn't always listen, and far too often had to learn by trial and error. Granted, far too many people haven't had the benefit of a stable, loving family like I did.
It's a shame you can't teach common sense or basic human kindness. Simply combine the two and you won't have to read a book to tell you how to prioritize what to get pissed off over.</review-text>

		<review-text>This book is one long anecdotal story after another (and so useless) by someone who couldn't be bothered with science or getting a degree... well, the 5-star reviews proves there's no reason to give a darn (for Amazon) about knowing what you're talking about. The road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Manson brags &quot;I think I'm wrong&quot; and adds &quot;I told you not to take me seriously, remember?&quot; These are the most accurate and useful statements about himself and his work.

Manson talks about &quot;COMFORTABLE WITH BEING DIFFERENT&quot; - seemingly talking about the Happy Days Fonzie character.

Then, he downplays indifference and being a couch potatoe... I am sick and tired of nothing and people who do nothing getting a bad rap as most people only do what should accurately be called less than nothing (making nothing something and even impressive). For example, the book Dead Aid talks about how relief efforts are in fact the primary cause of hunger and violence in Africa. Plus, DARE is so well documented to be a primary cause of drug use by young children that it's illegal to use federal dollars to fund it and yet most schools have it. Why? Because it's all just to make overtly stupid and lazy people feel important without actually having to know anything. Dr. Deming (the father of Quality Mgt) said without an understanding of the underlying science and math that one is incapable of thirty years of experience, only one year thirty times over (so experience does not trump education). Moreover, the Downing Effect is about how those who are sure they know what they're doing (or saying) are actually the most lost (and we all know from high school that the person who talks about it the most is doing it the least). If you needed a heart transplant would you let me do it even if I really really cared? Duh, no. My education level would rightly be your primary concern.

Overcoming adversity, success, in the real world, is generally the result of but dumb luck and arbitrary advantages ... anyone who tells you differently (or that it's admirable) just wants their mommy to be right about calling them special (like Manson). Malcolm Gladwell tells in Outliners of Dr. Barnley finding the best hockey players are five times more likely born in January that November or December, baseball players are twice as likely born in August than July, and soccer players are mostly likely born in September (now January as well). Why is something so arbitrary as birth month so important to athletic success? Young children born just after the age cut offs in the respective kid's leagues. And, kids bigger from being older get labeled &quot;naturally gifted&quot; and thus get more encouragement and training (something external) - what is the real key for success. Most people like to believe they have greater character but the truth is that all of us (like you) lie about 200 times a day (as per Ekman and many others), would torture anyone to death if simply asked (as per Milgram and many others), and steal whenever they or you believe you can get away with it (as per the MMPI and many many others) because nobody has any morals at all - just sad little self-confirming delusions.

When I'm at the grocery store, I usually take some time negotiating what I will pay (and I generally win). Everything in life is negotiable and anyone not willing to do so (or put the idea down with a story about some pitiful old woman as does Manson) just doesn't get it. Now that I am older, I have much less patience and a lot more darns (and darning). If I had a time machine, I would go back in time and tell myself to give ten times more darns than I did (and I would have been much more threatening about it... aka the Fonz character again). Christ was a master darner and they killed him for it (much like how not a one of Einstein's teachers was impressed with him). If you have numerous friends and admirers, well duh, you may be a sociopath -- half of which we jail while we foolishly admire the other half (for being charming as per Stout). And, like any common sociopath, the book advises to be skeptical of your emotions (the hate of which defines them) but also fails to recommend a class in statistics (or any real work, another key characteristic).</review-text>

		<review-text>So far the book is excellent and thought provoking. However I got charged twice for the Audible version and twice for the Kindle readable version, its a good read/listen but not for $54.04....pretty aggravating to be honest.</review-text>

		<review-text>No, I did NOT read the book. I don't even want to read the entire title. My reaction is similar to those who see the word God, Jesus or Bible and immediately find offense. Obviously, I will be ridiculed for finding offense in the profane word which occurs in this title, while at the same time, idiots don't ridicule themselves for finding offense in Christian words. Even Greg Gutfeld, in one of his books, said that he likes to debate, but if you use a quote out of the Bible, then SHUT UP. So, I then decided to use a quote out of his book, and then, SHUT THE BOOK. THE POINT: It works both ways.</review-text>
