		<review-text>For what I want a flash drive to do, this is perfect. I have several of these, and mostly use them to transfer files between non-networked computers. Nothing huge, so the speed limitations of USB 2.0 aren't an issue- I can wait an extra 2 seconds for things to copy. The small size of the drive is both a positive and negative attribute; I have lost them before, but they're very easy to keep in every laptop bag I have, on a keychain, etc. And given the price, losing one or two has never been heartbreaking (any files on them also exist on multiple laptops and backups, so that's not really a concern).

I've been using these for a few years now, and never had one fail. What brought me back to write a review most recently is that this weekend I actually put one through the washing machine and tumble dry in the pocket of a pair of jeans- and it still works like a charm today. For a sub-$10 flash drive, I was shocked. Then again, that's why all the flash memory I buy is SanDisk!</review-text>

		<review-text>Exactly what I needed and wanted for my digital photo frame! The flash-drive does not retract, which is perfect for me because it already has a &quot;forever&quot; home in the frame's drive slot. And, because it does not retract, the entire unit is shorter in length, so you cannot see it sticking out from the back, sides, or top, like all my other flash drives. I'd imagine this would apply to most smaller computer electronics where you don't want the flash drive visible. Scandisk has great quality, as usual, for our day to day photos of family, friends, and pets. I have never had a problem with any Scandisk product. So, folks, I would call this a win-win! Hope this helps!</review-text>

		<review-text>Can never really go wrong with SanDisk. I've always bought my flash drives and sd cards (both standard and micro) SanDisk brand, because it's such a reliable brand. So I was already expecting a decent product before this arrived, and sure enough I like the product and it works as expected. The password protection Option/SanDisk SecureAccess Software is useful (for anyone who doesn't know, it is in fact an option because you can remove that feature from the flash drive). For being a 2.0 the data transfer speed is good, of course that also depends on your file sizes, but the music and photos I transferred...transferred fast. The only thing I'm not too crazy about is the size, it's a bit too tiny, a lot smaller than SanDisk flash drives I've purchased in the past, and I feel it is easier to loose. But that's just me, some people might prefer this tinier option. I will say, it does state &quot;Ultra-Compact&quot; now that I look back over the specs, so I guess I initially overlooked that. It also doesn't have the typical retractor feature that most SanDisk flash drives have, but that's already apparent in the images. But overall it's a reliable and solid product.</review-text>

		<review-text>I ordered a 32 gb drive, it shows as 32 gb, but it doesn't even hold 22 gb. I believe they hacked it to look bigger than it is - something very dangerous as people can lose vital documents when this smaller drive reports that it is larger! In this screenshot, I've loaded 16.3 gb of data (17.5 B bytes), and 12.8 gb shows as available (13.8 B bytes). I attempt to add a 4.45 gb file and it fails because there isn't enough space. This drive is smaller than it is sold as.</review-text>

		<review-text>I was looking for a cheap USB drive to use to back up my MP3 song library, and I caught this little rascal on sale for $9.99. I didn't mind that it was USB 2.0 and thus slower than 3.0 because not only was speed not an important factor to me, but also because I have read in the reviews of 3.0 drives that they get hot when copying, and that some of them get literally too hot to handle. I don't care if that is normal or not, it doesn't sit right with me, so I'm staying with slow and dependable.

I did 2 large copies to this drive (large for me, anyway). The first was my MP3 digital music library. Nothing for the record books but dear to me, it totaled 2032 files and 6.64 GB, according to Win 7. The displayed speed varied between 6.0-7.0 MB/sec. The copy took 17:28 (watching the Windows clock and the British Open at the same time, so definitely not a scientific measure), for a calculated speed of 6.34 MB/sec. I'm sure many will howl that this is dreadfully slow, but again, I don't care. Also, the drive did not warm up at all, but stayed at room temperature through all the copies.

I also copied over an archive drive, which was mostly photos (JPEGs), with a few text files, some e-books, and a complete copy of Diablo II (D2's 11 MPQ files totaled 1.87 GB - over half the total copy). The total copy was 786 files comprising 3.17 GB. The copy displayed a speed of 6.5-7.0 MP/sec throughout, and took 7:38 to complete, which calculates to 6.92 MB/sec.

I am totally happy with this drive and its performance. The only caveat is that it is *really* small. I have heard these drives referred to as &quot;thumbnail drives&quot;, but this is the first time that I have seen one that is actually the size of my thumbnail !!! I didn't include a picture, since other reviews have already done so. I agree with other reviewers that this small size is probably intended for use in the dashboard of a car, and it would be great for that use. I just wish it came in a container of some sort, or had some way to protect the &quot;plug-in part&quot;, which I'm assuming is the most vulnerable part of a USB drive. Because of that, which worries me a bit, I'm giving it a 4/5 rather than a 5/5.</review-text>

		<review-text>Mine arrived with the plastic USB connection part squashed flat enough that it wouldn't fit into USB ports until I heated it up and formed it back into a rectangular shape. Be aware these seem to be made of some really cheap plastic and the port end has no metal reinforcement to keep its shape.

Once I repaired it, I managed to get it to squeeze into its intended port (a Roku TV, for live TV recording) and there it will stay, simply because I don't want to have to struggle with it again. I would absolutely NOT recommend this model for anyone who wants a portable, frequently plugged-in-and-removed flash drive. If, however, you need a flash drive that will sit in a USB port semi-permanently, this is a good value... As long as you take care when you first try to use it.

Three stars. It's Okay, but it's definitely built cheaply.</review-text>

		<review-text>Piece of Junk. It cracked and fell apart within a month. It still worked so I kept it. I mean, it still works after a year or more but I am considering the trash can after finding a little piece of plastic in my USB hub. Do yourself a favor and get something else.</review-text>

		<review-text>I used this to put on 50 GB of music that I ripped into MP3s and listen to in my car. Works great. I wish they had this technology when I was younger. I used to carry 30 to 60 cassettes in my car for listening to. Then I switched to CD's and had a big case with all the CD's. Now I have this Flash Drive and it has over 500 albums on it. I just keep it in my USB port and have all the music I have ripped so far on this. Still have another 250-300 Cassettes and Albums to turn into CD's, then rip to MP3s, but I have more music than most. Love it and have made a couple for my wife and friends. A great pleasure to share and made people very happy.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is the perfect thumb drive. It's thin, light, compact and doesn't take up much space at all (also aesthetically pleasing). The model I have holds 16GB, which means you can store tens of thousands of pictures, thousands of songs, and could back up possibly 7 or 8 full length movies, depending on their file size. I've had no problems with this device whatsoever and it certainly serves its purpose. As for the data transfer speed, I'm not too sure how to test it, but it seems to transfer great amounts of data at a pretty decent rate. So unless you need a thumb drive that handles super fast data transfers and you're not patient enough to wait a couple of minutes to transfer a large file, this is the perfect device. Hope this helps.</review-text>

		<review-text>It still amazes me that my first desktop had 15 gigs of memory, this tiny drive has over twice that. I stored everything that I wanted to keep backed up, 1,000s of pictures, about a thousand songs, dozens of folders of information on my Reiki classes, and it's about 1/4 filled. I am really happy with this one as it will store about anything I want to back up.......now if I don't lose the flash drive.</review-text>

		<review-text>Ordered this for my new Chevy Trax stereo because it has the USB slot to read music instead of an MP3 player. Music was easy to put on the flashdrive with my computer but wouldn't read in the car. Then it dawned on me, this flashdrive comes with security protection program on it that encrypts the info. Went back to my computer &amp; just deleted all files on it, reloaded music &amp; then it worked awesome for the car. Would highly recommend this easy fix to the new vehicle radios without CD's now.</review-text>

		<review-text>A perfect little USB key to have kicking around the computer workshop for moving incidental files between systems . It also comes in handy for making bootable usb drives for windows installation, SSD migration and other needs where speed isn't critical. It's small and inexpensive.

		<review-text>I really like this flash drive. I purchased it a few months ago for a class I'm taking that requires dealing with large amounts of data, so I chose this flash drive because of the low price. I've had no problems with data corruption or anything so far (knock on wood) and the flash drive is a really nice compact size, much smaller than you would expect for 32GB. The only reason I won't give it a five star rating is because the hole for a key ring is very flimsy. I've had the flash drive on my key ring and just a couple days ago the plastic broke and the drive fell off my key ring. Needless to say, if I hadn't noticed it I would have lost a semester's worth of work (including my final project). So overall I would recommend this product, just be careful if you intend to put it on a key ring.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is a small and compact product that's great for storage. I actually used it for a recovery drive, but it can be used for almost anything given that there is enough space, and also given that it's formatted correctly. Mine didn't need to be reformatted as the software did that for me, but I do know that some things require reformatting of flash drive before use, so just be aware of that. Anyways, this is a great product and I recommend it to those who need some extra storage.</review-text>

		<review-text>2 flash dives 16G for under 10 bucks.....um -YES. Another great SanDisk product. I didn't realize when ordering these that they were super compact, which may have pros and cons to it, but for me it was a pro. I plan on shipping some photos overseas with one of the drives so it makes the shipping weight almost nothing, big bonus. The only drawback I feel with the super small stuff is of course....easy to lose.

And I have always had good luck with SanDisk products, they have always been easy to use, including this new thumb drive.
Just plug it in, choose open folder to view files, and start dragging or copying whatever you want to move.
You can't always rely on a &quot;cloud&quot; to get files with internet connectivity, I may just buy 2 more!</review-text>

		<review-text>Tiny SanDisk is so inconspicuous that others may think you are on a secret mission to steal documents!

But, If you're not a secret agent, it is handy for carrying your music or photos on a key chain. Easily plugs into your car's audio system in a tight spot.

Only drawback is that it's so small you might lose it.</review-text>

		<review-text>OMG, this is tiny. I mean, I've seen smaller, but golly is this small. Seems the more years go by, the smaller and cheaper these things get. Remember when a 500K one was something to be treasured? (Maybe you're not as old as me.)

So I like this! Great for system backups on my laptop without breaking the bank.

So far, it has not changed my life, made me more attractive, or improved my own memory. So it loses one star. :-)</review-text>

		<review-text>hello,
sandisk makes great sd cards and flash drives. they are one of the original flash drive companies back in the early days. this one was purchased as a minimal size drive for transferring a ton of photos and videos. the web services were not to our liking and we want to control our own data. most drives are the standard 3/4 x 2 1/2 with caps or slide outs for connections. this one has an unusual shape that allows you to grip it well. also, it stands out on your desk or in a drawer among all of the other standard sized flash drives. for a simple unusual looking flash drive with the sandisk quality, this is the one to have. 4gb was plenty for many photos and videos to transfer. great drive and fast delivery...</review-text>

		<review-text>Things I liked:
* compact
* durable
* no moving parts
* it is possible to attached a string to it
* inexpensive

Things to improve:
* no led indication
* no cover to protect the connector (although in many cases those covers are very easy to lose)
* my win7 indicated that the device was not successfully installed. However, it actually was...

This device comes with a secure access software and some backup option via some online service. I have not used any of these but they might be useful for people who are looking to secure data on this device or to backup the device. I personally don't hold any sensitive files on it so would like to keep it simple.

I would have given this USB drive 5 stars if it had a led and if they sort out the win7 issue which may confuse inexperienced users.</review-text>

		<review-text>Do not buy this product if you are downloading files &gt;4 gb. This product is formatted with FAT32 file system and this is not disclosed. Must be converted to a different filing system, which is a pain!! Amazon will not accept return. I asked an IT friend for help -- she had never seen this and did not know why my files wouldn't download until we contacted SanDisk. Ancient technology.</review-text>

		<review-text>I needed a thumb drive that would work for soft-kidding an Original Xbox. Unfortunately, most sold in store today and online are too big to work. There are lists of compatible ones online, but the thumbdrives are hard to find and can actually fetch a premium when you do. I decided to try this one because most of the older ones in the family of thumbdrives have worked.

It worked perfectly and the price was fantastic. Although you can get higher storage limits for the same price, legacy devices require a smaller storage size and as they've become harder to get, the prices can be triple or more for a comparable size. Add to that the fact that it's a SanDisk, and it was no brainer. SanDisk memory cards and drives are the only brand that hasn't failed me yet (knock on wood).</review-text>

		<review-text>To create a bootable Windows 7 thumb drive with this Sandisk Cruzer you'll need the ISO and this from Microsoft: Windows7-USB-DVD-Download-Tool-Installer-en-US .

		<review-text>I bought several products together. I also purchased one last year. They are working very well. Only the point that I am worried is the size being so small. When I took it out from my PC, I worried it gets broken. So far it is not broken, but from this compact size, it can be broken easily. San Disk has always very good reputation. I hope this product will continue to help me without any break.

There is a small hall in the side. I connected with a key chain. So if you think you may lose it, you can put it with a key chain or something very visual in the case you lost.</review-text>

One thing though, it's freaking tiny; about a inch and a half long. I'm kinda scared I might lose it. Also, the pictures posted by San disk never showed the other side, the red side.

		<review-text>I purchased the SanDisk Cruzer 4GB USB flash drive not for personal use, but to send a photo file as a gift. It worked well. Picture quality and speed of transfer were satisfactory. The unit is probably good for office work. However I felt it was a little &quot;light weight/flimsy&quot; for someone working in the field. I generally carry my flash drive in my pant's pocket or shirt pocket while working. Many times the drive is bumped against, dropped onto concrete floors and even laid on, so I tend to lean toward a sturdier unit.
I have had great luck with the Corsair Flash Voyager and Survivor models. However these are not for everyone. They tend to be bulky, but they take a beating.</review-text>

		<review-text>I didn't expect this to be so small, but it is a great buy. I got this to hold movies for my German class, and so far, I've been able to fit 12. All of which, run smoothly on the USB with no lag or problems of any kind. The download speeds were faster for me than what I read in other reviews, although that does depend on the size of files, but mine were movies so anything bigger than 1gb should be good. Besides the sleek design and hole for key ring, I dislike it not having a flashing light or cover. Those are only minor grievances, but the biggest beef I have with this USB, is that it only has a little over 13GB, even though it's advertised as 16GB.
Besides this, It's a phenomenal product and I strongly suggest it.</review-text>

		<review-text>It comes with 1.2 GB of some security software for encryption protection. When I installed the flash drive in my computer for the first time my computer showed it only had 14.8 GB of actual available space to use. This isn't necessarily a problem as I don't intend to use that much space right now anyway, but I thought I would mention that fact. It might be an issue for some people. It's lightweight and so tiny that I think I might lose it. My keychain is too big for it so I need to find a smaller, thinner one. Like it so far though.</review-text>

		<review-text>In most cases I turn to sandisk or lexar but I like this usb better than my old lexar thumb drive. It's compact and good for storing files of almost all types. 8 gig is big enough to carry most of my work files but the actual usb is small enough to carry around in my pocket. Good capacity for price and I like the design. Affodable and convenient size, I recommend this sandisk drive for home or the office.</review-text>

		<review-text>The cruzer blade is a sharp little flash drive I'm in my late 20's and my first flash drive was a san disk 256 mb drive that cost 5 times as much. Who would have thunk that 16 gigs would fit in something the size of your little finger. My only problem with the cruzer which may not bother everyone is the lack of a cover but hey we usually loose these things anyways. The drive has rapid data transfers and is small enough to fit just about any where. My only other beef is the lack of a necklace. It would have been a nice addition to such a small drive as its size makes it prone to misplacement. Other than that I would highly recommend this product to someone in the market for a tiny 16 gig flash drive.</review-text>

		<review-text>If you're looking for a really cheap but nice quality flash drive, this is what you're looking for. The first few things to note is that I made my rating of 5 stars based on Cost vs Quality, While this might only be a USB 2.0 which is definitely an older version of flash drives, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's &quot;worse&quot;. The data transfer rates will be slightly slower than modern flash drives but when you compare the price of $12 vs $5 i would say that you're getting the better end! The flash drive is much smaller than expected, but works like I would have hoped. Cheap, nice quality, compact...</review-text>

		<review-text>So far so good. I'm only using it in my xbox 360 as additional storage so can't really say how it performs in normal use. File transfer and read/write speed is adequate and probably much better rated than the xbox can even make use of. I did have one issue once where the console didn't recognize the drive after being connected. After removing and re-connecting several times I eventually had to restart my console to get it to see the USB drive. This is most likely an issue with the xbox rather than the drive itself though. All in all a good little drive for a good price.</review-text>

		<review-text>Very nice usb keychain, but extremely slow!
Write speeds equal around 4MB/s which is VEEERY slow, about 10x slower than most modern usb sticks.
Read speeds are quite fast. The device is good enough for a USB radio, or storing photo's on.

The stick hardly gets warm, does not have an internal LED.

The borders are made of plastic, coated with rubber, even the USB plug outside is made of plastic, not metal like most usb plugs.
Good enough to be a cheap drive,

		<review-text>I've had this tiny drive for about 2 weeks now and use it exclusively in my XBOX 360.

Since the max partition the XBOX can make is 32GB, this is the perfect drive to store all my games and apps. And once Far Cry 4 is released, I'll be buying another drive for the 2nd USB slot for a total of 64GB to store beaucoup stuff.

		<review-text>Since I don't use a lot of memories, I don't really need an external hard drive for back up, so I thought I would buy this flash drive and use it as a back up drive for my files. The drive is very small, but not small enough where you might misplace it. So far it works really great. Coping a 1GB file takes about three minutes. I would say that's very fast. But to erase a 1GB file would take longer time. Nevertheless, it's a very nice drive.</review-text>

		<review-text>This was a black Friday deal and with the amount of GB's, I couldn't pass it up.

However, I realized once I got it...that I didn't need such a secure flash drive. It has you download software, and once you put the files on this thing; they are nice and secure. Unless someone really knows how to hack, I doubt anyone is going to access this information.

With that said, my point of getting one was to easily transfer files from one device to another. I need to have the software on all my devices in order to do that.

Since I am interested in sharing files; I've had to learn how to keep it out of &quot;the vault&quot; and just on the drive so that I can share. So, if that is your intent...you will be fine with a regular flash drive. If you want security, this is the one for you.</review-text>

		<review-text>I have had this drive for four months. I use it in the course of my duties as a computer technician to house backup files, operating system images, and I use it as a storage device for our scanner. The read/write speed is so/so....I have seen faster, I have seen slower. If you are looking for speed THIS DRIVE IS NOT FOR YOU. That being said, this is a tiny flash drive. It comes with a slot for a lanyard, but does not have a lanyard included; I use a keyring on mine just so I don't lose it.

However, over the past couple of days, the drive is starting to fail me. I have tried this on multiple computers and get the same result: the drive does not always get recognized when you plug it in. I have to unplug it, wait a few seconds, and replug it in, rinse and repeat, until it finally works; I think it is safe to say that the drive is possibly failing, but I don't know how. Maybe it is from plugging it in a couple hundred times?

If you want a decent drive and speed isn't your concern, go for this drive, considering it is small and holds a lot of information. Just be careful not to lose it.</review-text>

		<review-text>I have not tried the device as of yet, however, as soon as I got it I realized to things: 1. the structure and quality of materials seem to be rather cheap, and most importantly, it does not come with a cover. I bought it to storage music from an old PC which I plan to toss away and not I am concern with whether the dust and other pollutants will get into it. Although it is surprisingly affordable, am not sure if I recommend it, unless you intend to stick it in the computer as a back up device. Hope it helps.</review-text>

		<review-text>i purchased this to put a few videos on it for playing through my sony media player for an event at our bar. the video files were about 3gb each, and i put four of them on this stick. the write transfers took about 12 minutes each (ouch!) using usb 2.0, which is about what i had expected based on the other reviews here.

with the exception of being a bit on the slow side for writing files in, this drive has performed very well. i have been using it for large file transfers for about a month now, and it has not missed a beat.

take note though, if you're going to be using this for files larger than 4gb, that you first make sure the drive is formatted to NTFS instead of FAT. FAT32 filesystems don't accommodate individual files larger than the 4gb size. this goes for ANY usb drive, not just the sandisk.

for what it is, this drive is worth buying. it's not a performance machine, but you won't find a high-performance usb drive available for $.60/gb anytime soon.</review-text>

		<review-text>Pros: Inexpensive, sleek design, relatively small (if you want amazingly tiny, look at the Sandisk Cruzer Fit)

Cons: The plug itself is plastic rather than metal. Don't know whether it will chip or crack over time. No problems so far.

Comments: I left this in my shirt pocket and it went through both the washer and the dryer, normal cycles (warm water, hot dryer). Found it in the lint basket when we pulled out the clothes. I waited till the next morning before plugging it into my laptop in case there was any moisture still inside. It booted up fine, all data intact. The case was no worse for the wear. I was impressed.

Some models offer a separate or built-in cover for the plug. This model doesn't have one. But I don't think its missed. As noted, very sleek design, good price.</review-text>

I purchased three to have 3 different Boot/Install/Recuse disks for OSX, Linux and Windows. Also great for transferring data and media. Find an way to label or mark them externally if you are purchasing multiple units. Slightly faster than PNY, Lexmar and Infinative usb drives.

		<review-text>Would have given it 5 stars, but I had to try three times to get the security program to work, so now I'm afraid to use it, because if it malfunctions, I'll lose my files. The transfer speeds on it were very good for a USB 2 stick, noticeably faster than the other ones I have, especially at writing to the stick. It feels pretty flimsy compared to other ones I own, so we'll see how it holds up. If it falls apart or stops working, I will be back to update this.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is a great, affordable, reliable product. However if you're looking for a flash drive designed for travel, like on a keychain or in a purse, you may be better to choose a retractable option that protects the plug itself.

I own 3 of these Blade drives. They are an excellent choice for a flash USB solution in tight spaces. Works great at the back of a Blue Ray player to increase capacity for movie extras, as well as for music in cars with USB audio.

I would have given 5 stars, if it weren't for durability. As other reviews likely mention, the plug itself is plastic. Although this characteristic may be favorable in some instances, it likely won't hold up under hard use (I also own a couple Cruzer Titanium drives with dents from surviving drops). On the upside, this drive is likely less durable than what you plug it into- so if someone happens to break one off in your car audio system, it's less likely to damage the USB jack on the vehicle, potentially saving a costly trip to service.</review-text>

		<review-text>I hate these! I have some 4gb sandisk cruiser blades and they work just fine. These however freeze my pc every time I plug one in and try to read or write to it. I've tried on multiple pcs and the same thing happens. I won't buy these again. What a waste of money.

Update: So these say 2.0 usb but they seem to only function properly when I use my usb 3.0 I am thoroughly confused. At this point I've thrown in the towel. Whatever. I'll keep them since I've gotten them to function in some capacity. I do think it is false advertising. They do not work on usb 2.0 only 3.0</review-text>

		<review-text>About a year ago I purchased these drives, and I bought them in bulk some from amazon and others from the local electronics store (30 units).

Every drive lasted me about 15-30 days. What a pile of s***, luckily I was just using these drives for non mission critical things and I didn't mind if they broke cause I had a backup and only needed them for updating firmware on servers &amp; changing passwords.

If you want a reliable drive stay away from these, the housings crack easy, they stop reading, and they are slow as s***.</review-text>

		<review-text>This drive is tiny, smaller than my thumb, but packs a good bit of storage in a very tiny space. It has a hole for a lanyard or keyring to attach to it so you don't lose track of it.

If you're prone to losing small things, I definitely recommend attaching it to something, but this is great for extremely portable storage. I wouldn't recommend putting it in a pocket or somewhere it might get squished, as it looks like it could snap easily, but if used as intended, it should last a long time.</review-text>

		<review-text>The product is GREAT! However, it has a driver in it that needs to be installed on the computer. For MY laptop, that is fine - no problem. However, my reason for purchasing this product was to be able to use it at my local library's computers. They do not allow outside software to be installed on their computers; therefore I cannot install the driver for this product, and cannot use it for what I wanted it for. If you are buying this for the same reason I did, be advised of this, as it does not say in the product description that it contains a driver to be installed. I would have appre ciated knowing that BEFORE deciding whether or not to buy it.</review-text>

I love how it has a little hole so that I can tie it to my lanyard or hang it on my wall near my laptop so that I wont loose. Especially since its tiny and I could easily lose it.</review-text>

		<review-text>The USB works great with myth surface RT. It seamlessly streams my music from the USB onto my device without any issues whatsoever. My only issue is that when downloading movies to the USB, my surface has a hard time playing the files consistently but that may be a technical issue with the surface. However, overall this was a great buy.</review-text>

		<review-text>These are perfect for my office whenever I need to transfer big files between co-workers. Plus, they're not those annoying flash drives that have the slide out USB port which sometimes loses the tension which means you have to hold down the button to plug them into a port. UGH! These are perfect for quick transfers and fits easily on a keyring.</review-text>

		<review-text>It is important to note that this stick will appear on your PC as a fixed-disk and not a removable-disk. This will not matter to most people, but if you are using this to create a bootable drive for Linux or Windows, you may have trouble doing that. Many of the utilities that create bootable media on USB specifically look for a &quot;removable drive&quot; in your PC and will not see this stick. SanDisk says they did this for Windows 8 compliance.

If you are going to put music or movies on this then I highly recommend it. If you are going to make bootable media then I don't.</review-text>

		<review-text>PROS: Bought the 16GB Sandisk Cruzer Blade to store backup programs that I also loaded on my desktop. One thing is for sure. The Cruzer is a small and handy computer accessory. SandDisk put the thumb groove on the top where it belongs so that its easy to insert the flash correctly in the USB port. The Cruzes quality is excellent and it works great for extra storage. Also liked the idea of the flash's password security software preinstalled. Your choice to activate it, remove it or not.

CONS: Not any really. Could have a plastic cover for the USB end and an LED would have been nice to show when its recording data. But that would probably increase its meager price.

All in all, a great buy especially if you are looking for an extra 16GB of storage space!</review-text>

		<review-text>This is probably the best flash drive I have owned. Ignoring the fact that it is 2.0, it seems to be incredibly well built. The fit is tight in the slot, but in a good way, and most of it is metal but with a small plastic piece on one side that seems to be firmly attached to the rest of the flash drive. I will update on durability if anything goes wrong, but I don't really expect it to. 5 *s</review-text>

		<review-text>If you want a flashdrive to snap to your key to-go, this flashdrive might not be for you. The little hole on the top corner will break if you snap it to your key and it doesn't sustain the everyday use. You might need to find a small wire strap for the flashdrive before you can hang it to your keychain because it will make it easier to plug it in the computer (especially laptop) and more durable for everyday use.

The speed of this flashdrive was awesome as Sandisk is famous for their flashdrive speed. :-). It was my favorite flashdrive until the top corner broke and fell from my key chain. :-(</review-text>

		<review-text>Too slow for XBOX, whatever that actually is. Not much more to say. I guess that's what you get for what's probably the least expensive 16GB drive available at the moment. I do like the size, because anticipating that it might be too slow, I planned to swap it with a Pico drive Super Talent Pico-C 16 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive STU16GPCS (Silver) that I've had sitting in the front of my older LG BD 390 Network Blu-ray Disc Player just to hold exercise videos. That Pico drive is just a few $ more and meets XBOX standards. This drive seems to be doing okay just playing back the compressed video through the BD player.</review-text>

		<review-text>I bought this to make a data backup of my laptop so I could safely factory reset it. After I factory reset my laptop I was going to reuse this flashdrive to back up the freshly started laptop. If you make this as a backup option, don't format it. If you format it, it still thinks it's locked to the older program and won't work as another back up option. It works amazingly as just a plain ole flashdrive though.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is a nice size for a drive, quite small. Like many other small drives though, this one is a good bit slower than the better drives out there:

---------------- Averages for &quot;NO NAME&quot; (2GB/4MB, 5 iterations) ----------------
Iteration 1, 4.5 Write MB/sec, 19.8 Read MB/sec
Iteration 2, 4.5 Write MB/sec, 20.4 Read MB/sec
Iteration 3, 4.4 Write MB/sec, 20.5 Read MB/sec
Iteration 4, 4.5 Write MB/sec, 20.7 Read MB/sec
Iteration 5, 4.5 Write MB/sec, 20.9 Read MB/sec

Slowest 4.43 Write MB/sec, 19.8 Read MB/sec
Fastest 4.53 Write MB/sec, 20.9 Read MB/sec
Average 4.47 Write MB/sec, 20.5 Read MB/sec
Median 4.46 Write MB/sec, 20.5 Read MB/sec
Range 0.10 Write MB/sec, 1.08 Read MB/sec

(Just for comparison, the Patriot Xporter XT, another drive I reviewed recently, has writes of ~11MB/sec and reads of ~36MB/sec, so this drive is roughly half of one of the faster drives out there.)

Anyway, cheap, small, and slow. But all in all not bad if (cheap + small) &gt; fast.</review-text>

		<review-text>I've ordered other storage media manufactured by SanDisk and haven't, to date, had any problems at all. And..so far, so good w/ this 16Gb Flash Drive. The only minor complaint I might have is this particular model doesn't have a built-in cap, an many flash drives do these days(but I suppose I could cover w/ plastic wrap or similar). Other than that..it boots up quickly and writes and reads well. Plenty of storage space! I can highly recommend this flash drive.</review-text>

		<review-text>Yes, these work, but they are slow and of low quality. Do recommend that you format as NTFS vs FAT32- that will help a bit with the speed. They don't even come with a cover to protect USB end. I've never seen that on any flash drive before. After purchasing them I found out that you can purchase the covers separately. REALLY? why not just include them with Flash Drives? Are they really that expensive that you need to sell them separate and charge separate S&amp;H? Do not recommend these.</review-text>

		<review-text>I bought this because it was an excellent value for the storage space. And I thought the size was sort of a cool, low profile. But that proved to be a problem when I gave it to somebody, they put it in their shirt pocket and it was so low profile they forgot it was there. A couple of days later they realized they had lost it and couldn't find it anywhere. Here's the part that makes me give it 4-stars instead of 3. They put it through the washer and dryer before they found it and it still works. I've been using it for months since then with no problems in the functionality or construction.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is a truly pocket sized gadget and I have it hanging on my keychain. (Don't leave home without it!) I took a length of accessory cord (small-gauge climbing rope) from the sporting goods store and manged to get it through the tiny hole, to make a loop so I wouldn't lose the thing.

Upsides: weighs nothing, small, sturdy, works well, pretty fast.

Downsides: easy to lose (see above); no markings (or they wore off) stating the size, so I can't really tell the difference between my 16 GB one and this 32 GB one.</review-text>

		<review-text>The SanDisk Cruzer Blade flash drive is functional and does what it is supposed to do. It's a quick and easy way to store files. The one drawback is that is super small. Even with the tiny flash of red, this drive could easily be misplaced even in plain sight. The drive doesn't come with a case, so you're on your own for storage.</review-text>

		<review-text>I was looking for a 16GB flash drive to supplement the memory for my new 4GB XBOX. Searching Amazon, the Cruzer Blade seemed to provide the most memory for the cost among recognizable brands. It shipped quickly and arrived just days after ordering with Prime Shipping.

The drive works perfectly. It was completely &quot;plug &amp; play&quot;; no formatting or any other delays. It also came without any annoying additional programs to install. I've been using for more than a month now and I've had no issues.</review-text>

		<review-text>I keep losing flash drives.

I don't know how, but flash drives have entered the same category as sunglasses and scissors - they just up and disappear on a disturbingly regular basis.

So here's what I did: I bought a big lanyard holder. I bought two of these things. I then put them on a key ring and hung it by my office door.

Appears to have been a success. The drives themselves are quality, small enough to be unobtrusive but large enough not to look completely silly on a key ring.</review-text>

		<review-text>I had one of these (16 GB) for about a year. I either lost it or someone swiped it off my desk at work. I had no problems with it. Recently I replaced it with what I thought was the identical model. After two or three uses, none of my three computers would recognize it when it was plugged in.

I called Amazon and was sent a prompt replacement. Deja-vu all over again. After two uses, it was no longer recognized. I use Windows Vista on a Dell XPS desktop that's a couple of years old, and Lenovo laptop with Windows 7 installed, and I have never experienced problems along these lines with either machine.

Switching gears, one of the things that made me buy this thumb drive was its small size. It is truly miniscule. Well, that was a mistake. The drive is so small and light it's extremely easy to misplace. I kept mine in a small pouch with my digital recording equipment. (I'm a journalist.) I could never find the thing until I dumped everything out. It's an elusive little bugger.</review-text>

		<review-text>I've been using Cruzer Blades for years. I keep buying larger and larger ones as they become available. It's rugged because there's no moving parts. There's no retractable useless mechanism to lock, no stupid dust cap to lose because it's not included, and those don't matter anyway. You don't need a dust cap, stop it. They're smaller than the majority of other flash drives. They're perfectly contoured and shaped to fit firmly between your thumb and index finger so that they're extremely comfortable and easy to insert. When you push them in, they go in. When you pull them out, they come out. You'll be at least 50% less likely to insert them upside-down, and they just work.

I use them for everything. It's the best USB stick I've ever had attached to a keychain with 2 huge truck keys, 4 other car keys, 3 tool box keys, 4 work keys, and 5 house keys as well as some rappelling gear. Years like this. I work every day, and my keys are always with me. They get banged around, have been inserted and ejected into dozens if not hundreds of Macs and PCs at home and at work and have never failed. I still have and use every one of them I've ever bought, and in every storage capacity available since they were first produced.

They have hundreds of uses. Game storage, backups, installer media, bootable operating systems, automobile service records, presentations, desktop, documents, downloads, library, movies, music, pictures, sites, shared. All of the software I need to do my job, right there on the keychain. PDF service manuals for the equipment I repair go with me everywhere. I guess you could put stupid stuff like homework, or passwords or porn on it, but I don't because those things aren't fun. Well, mostly not fun... It's more fun to plug your whole music library into one of the USB slots on your brand new, shiny, technology-packed, voice-activated 6.1 digital surround sound equipped loaded premium model 4x4 truck and tell your truck what you want to hear. It's safer, too. For you and everybody else. Of course the truck is optional, but if your vehicle is equipped with these technologies, please do this. You'll never be the distracted one. The Cruzer Blade is perfect for this in the hot summer and in the cold of winter. I know this for a fact. Years like this. Always available. It will even let you use your phone storage for more useful and practical things, or it could even allow you to buy the smaller, less expensive, less storage capacity model of the same phone saving you hundreds of dollars. If you wanted to listen to music on the go, everything everywhere has USB, and it's all louder and sounds better than your phone. Go out to your truck and get it. Problem solved. Phone stays charged.

Pros: If you need a RED and BLACK, tough, simple, durable, stealthy USB 2.0 flash drive, then this is the best one ever made. Indisputable champion.

Cons: The form factor hasn't changed over the years, WHICH IS FANTASTIC! Don't change them in any physical or functional way... but the microscopic painted lettering eventually wears away on both sides, so you don't know if it's a 16 GB, 32 GB, 64 GB or 128 GB? You just know that it's the red and black one. I wish like crazy these things came in a dozen different colors. Maybe even get creative and make one that glows in the dark? Or polished Aluminum? Woodgrain? Tortoise shell? Burl? Clear? Of course I have nothing against red and black... I'm just sayin... it's the only way it could be improved, I don't know that any of this qualifies as a con? I have zero complaints with the quality of this product and my experience with using them. I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings, red and black. Long live the red and black Cruzer Blade USB 2.0 flash drives!</review-text>

Really, only drawback to me, feels like I'm gonna loose it and &quot;slip&quot; out of my fingers...just saying? What do you do...maybe a tad bit bigger would be my suggestion, or a gripper of some sort where your fingers hold it, other wise it does what it's supposed to;) The size is the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5, Ben.</review-text>

		<review-text>The first thing I noticed about the drive is that it is made of entirely plastic. The plug itself is very thin and seems like it could be broken very easily. I'm using the drive for an add-on for a stationary PC, so it isn't as much a problem for me, but I would consider something more substantial for an everyday carry.</review-text>

		<review-text>I purchased this item along with the NIX 8 Inch Hu-Motion Digital Photo Frame - X08C with Automatic ON/OFF Motion Sensor as a holiday gift. It's shocking to me how much the price of storage has dropped over the past few years -- I remember paying $150 just a few years ago for a 100GB external hard drive. I actually paid $8 for this SanDisk drive, but I see that the price has since dropped, and for $2 I don't think you can do any better. The security software that comes on the disk is a bit counterintuitive to install, and unnecessary for my use (loading photos for a digital picture frame), but could be worth the time.</review-text>

		<review-text>As a computer technician I keep several flash drives on hand in case a customer needs one. These are very handy (and inexpensive) for creating a system recovery disk, rather than using several DVD's, and are reusable if you replace your computer and need to create a new recovery disk. There are faster ones out there, but this serves the purpose and doesn't cost much.</review-text>

		<review-text>I've owned many different jump drives many types, many brands at all price points. This is definitely not the best/fastest jump drive I've bought however this little guy is good because of how small it is. It can be carried in a keychain and wont really make things too bulky like other jump drives. However there is one big con I had a real hard time finding a key ring that would fit it. Once i did it was nice to have on me at all times and it saved me in a couple of situations. But the design should have been thought better for it to work well with key chains or should have brought one of those small strings.</review-text>

		<review-text>For storage of info for long periods of time in a secure safe location, this might be decent. Unfortunately, I purchased this as a 16GB drive for running portable apps. Sluggish write speed made running web browsers off the drive barely tolerable.

I kept it attached to my key chain for eight months and while it never fell off, the plastic USB connector began chipping away. Wound up putting tape around to connector to try to preserve it, but that was only a stopgap.Rather than wait for the USB connector to wear into unusability, I switched to a Kensington DT101 G2 instead, which is performing significantly better.</review-text>

It's amazing how small this thing is, about half the size of conventional thumb-drives, which is perfect for this application. It uses all-plastic case construction, including the slot blade, which I hadn't seen before. So far, no problems at all, even leaving it in the car 24/7 and tossing it in the cup holder every night. It's not the fastest drive in the world, but since I don't write to it very often, that's not a problem for me.</review-text>

		<review-text>The packaging had been very carefully cut. Taking no chances, I formatted and scanned it. When I tried to copy pre-ripped musical CDs it would accept only about 8GBs, even though it indicated the full 14+ GBs were available. Amazon immediately credited my credit card, before I had even returned it with their free return label.</review-text>

If all they do is transfer the data to their laptops (took about 3 minutes to write 650 GB of files), it will have served its purpose before being crushed accidentally or otherwise malfunctions.</review-text>

		<review-text>this flash drive is very small and nice,BUT it lacks a strap so that you can carry it in your keychain.

when it comes to reading data, it does it pretty well, but when you start writing data on this drive it is PAINFULLY slow.

my readings were a mediocre 4 MB per second write on writing speed and a respectable 20 per second MB reading speed.

i give this item a 3 out of 5 rating.</review-text>

		<review-text>I wanted something small, so for me that is a plus, though for some it may be easy to lose. I have had several failures of cheap lexar media thumbdrives, but so far these fit the bill for being cheap and reliable. One reviewer said they are slow, and perhaps they are - but not an issue for me, since I purposely ordered small ones (4GB). For my application, quantity of drives (One distro each) was more important than speed or massive storage space. These are all still working 100%. A+++</review-text>

		<review-text>I can't rave about this thumb drive enough. I had all my midterm coursework on it and it slipped out of my pocket. I didn't realize it until the next day. It spent overnight in a dark rainy parking lot and got ran over the next morning. Best part was, a friend of mine found it after it had been missing for two days and I plugged it in (after making sure it was dry) and it STILL WORKED!!!!!!

I recommend this without any reservations. Seriously if you're prone to misplacing this this is awesome. However it is sort of small so I strongly suggest it be put on a lanyard or your keyring.</review-text>

		<review-text>I looked at faster options for a 32GB flash drive, but ultimately I wanted something durable for my keychain that didn't have a cap that I could lose. This fit the bill and it works very well. It's not nearly as fast as my WD My Passport 2TB Portable External Hard Drive Storage USB 3.0 Black but it works for what I need. I use it almost daily to transfer files between computers.

		<review-text>Been using this drive for over 6 months now and I can say it has its pros and cons( however better pros to me).
The main issue with this device is that it has a slow write speed. Aside that, I think it is very portable, sleek, durable, larg space, with a good read speed.
If it had to sacrifice write speed for all this then I'm ok. However, if the con can be improved upon then SanDisk should definitly go for it.</review-text>

		<review-text>Great drive for the money and the form factor. No sliding anything and no caps and it's small. I use it for backups on work computer, so haven't used it for music or video streaming.

Recommended for anyone looking for small for factor, easy to use, lots of space for the money.

I've owned this one for about 9 months and it works fine. No issues. SanDisk always good to me.

Edit - updated review since I bought it. It died a few months after I wrote this, not to mention it kept getting slower and slower and slower. I only ever used it at home with my main workstation.</review-text>

		<review-text>I had this product for around two years. It still works great. I bought this mainly because it was black and red(someone tell me that I wasn't the only one). It performs nicely with plenty of storage on the go. It's small and convenient to bring with you and store anywhere. If you're afraid of losing this, as it is small, you can attach a phone strap onto it, or some kind of strap that makes it less harder to lose. For me, I attached a turtle onto my flash drive. I purchased this through Amazon.</review-text>

		<review-text>I bought a pair of these to use for additional memory for my Xbox. They're too slow and don't meet performance recommendations. Playing DLC from them is impossible and copying any large file takes forever. Instead I got a slightly more expensive one from ADATA that's even USB 3.0 (I know that Xbox is only 2.0) and it works great. Playing DLC from it is no different from playing from the system drive and large files copy very quickly.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is a great &quot;little&quot; thumb drive, but, be careful not to misplace it, they are hard to find if you do. I put a key chain on them so I don't lose them, and, my cat also loves to get them on the floor and bat them around and I found it under the couch. Anyway, seems to be built very well and works great and that is what I am reviewing it on, not its size. These things are getting smaller every day and that is really what we want isn't it? They can easily be carried in your pocket on your key chain if you like since they are so light and small. Very nice good looking product.</review-text>

		<review-text>I can just say OK to this tiny little flash chip. The write-in speed is actually a little bit slow (about 3-4M/s in FAT32) as mentioned in the previous reviews.

		<review-text>I bought a Kia Soul. The Kia Soul has a radio. I hate most music on the radio. The Kia Soul has a USB port. Being the genius that I am, I saw this as an opportunity. I bought this handy little bit of reverse-engineered extraterrestrial technology, put all of my music on it, and now I run my own radio station from my car. It typically has only one listener. I'm still trying to figure out how to broadcast.</review-text>

		<review-text>...but I think its worth noting that there's no metal in the housing. It's completely made of plastic.

		<review-text>Fits real nicely on keychain and has good feel. I used to use a LaCie usb stick shaped like a key, but that one was long, thinner, but did become non-functional after 2 years of use. This Cruzer is more weakly constructed (plastic vs. metal) but is holding up well and the plastic covers the pins that I suspect what broke on the previous LaCie usb stick I had, as those were exposed.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is a great product. Ultra small, works reasonably fast, and great price too! But after a month it stopped working, and I had to get in touch with Sandisk. They were very professional, and sent me a replacement USB flash drive right away, and once again it works very well. This could have been one of those occasional lemons, but who knows there might be a reliability issue with this problem. I recommend you read other reviewers and see if theirs broke down too. Other than that a great product.</review-text>

		<review-text>Wow, this thing is SMALL.

The biggest concern I would have with this thing would be using it. I've been &quot;out of&quot; the flash drive world for a few years. I honestly think the last time I used one was 2009 for my high school, and it was a 1GB. These things have gotten bigger in memory and smaller in size. But boy does this thing work. I used this specifically for installing linux on a laptop and it worked flawlessly.

Right now I have it hooked up as an external file storage. I can imagine using this to transport photos, etc between computers. The argument can be made that the cloud is making these flash drives irrelevant, but for offline devices or plug-and-use functionality, SanDisk has done a fantastic job with this device. Just don't lose it!

As a side note for any potential Linux users as well, some people say they have issues installing Linux with SanDisk flash drives. I experienced no such issues thus far. I will update this review if the issues ever occur.</review-text>

		<review-text>I purchased this drive because I wanted something small enough to fit on my key chain and carry around with me every day.

I have been very disappointed. Write speeds are terrible compared to my other drives (including other small drives), takes nearly 10 minutes to load a 1 GB file (issue was experienced across multiple PCs and Macs, so not a limitation of the computer I was using).

On top of the slowness, the key chain hole broke after less than a month.

Not impressed, only reason to consider this is if you want something very small, and even then it would be better to keep looking.</review-text>

		<review-text>Transfer speeds are great on this drive. It's small and stylish as far as flash drives go. Because of it's size I can easily place it in my change pocket and go. One thing to be careful of is that because it is so small, it can be easily misplaced if you are the forgetful type. Don't leave it in your jeans on laundry day. Durable drive. Pick a few up and you'll be glad that you did.</review-text>

		<review-text>OK, this was quite small and I am a very clumsy person but once I attached a cord to it, I have never lost it! I love how small and light it is...it is small enough to fit into the USB port under my internet card (which nothing seems to fit under) and I can throw it in my pocket any time. The long cord I attached to it makes it obvious so I dont ever forget it in my pockets...so I highly recommend attaching SOMEthing to it!</review-text>

		<review-text>To make the long history short, i will say: this USB is the best one ever.
It is small, very good materials, innovative design, quality, mac compatible, so and so for...
The speed is kind of low, but not big deal. If you want speed, buy a firewire 800 compatible device.
I used this memory to move my pictures between my computer for post-processing, the speed is good enough, and it is reliable -its sandisk!-

		<review-text>For transferring 1 GB of File it takes more than 1 hour sometimes even a whole day is falling short for that. Tried with different PCs &amp; Laptops but same result.
This is the 2nd USB Pen Driver in a row which is directly shipped &amp; sold by amazon &amp; gives the same result of taking so much time in file transferring.

Its a Negative Star Product...Dont know how to rate Negative Star here on Amazon :(</review-text>

		<review-text>Was a bit surprised how small it was. About one third the size of my Kingston 4GB USB drive. Gave it four stars only because the size makes it easier to misplace and and the shipping cost more then I paid for it. Other then that I am very happy with it. I installed a full Linux operating system on it and you can barely detect a speed difference between it and a hard drive.</review-text>

		<review-text>VERY CHEAP!
It feels like a TOY. It's plastic.
At first when I opened the package... I felt it, thinking it was in a case... BUT NO!

Whoa! What is up with SanDisk! I love their products! ALL of my SD cars are SanDisk and most of my flash drives are as well.
I've known SanDisk to be the BEST memory product brand on the market... But they went downhill big time with the Blade!

I honestly NEVER thought I would give a product from SanDisk a low review like this...</review-text>

		<review-text>Nice compact size flash drive with lots of storage space. Works good with my windows PC, Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 7 (2013). Nexus devices require an USB OTG cable and the devices are unlocked and rooted using the Nexus Toolkit. Can store tons of files, apps (apk), movies, music files or whatever. The flash drive comes with some security software on it. I just formatted the drive as a fat32 device (more compatible with on the go USB hosting devices). Reads from the drive are fairly quick. Writes to the drive are noticeably slower, but that's pretty normal for flash drives. It is obviously much quicker if connected to a USB 2.0 port. This flash drive has no retractable connector or flashing LED activity light in case those are concerns for your particular needs. The lack of an LED light is beneficial for users of OTG USB since it draws less power from the smart phone or tablet while in use. Great little portable storage flash drive.

----------------------------

Update from March 15th 2015

I really liked this flash drive and it performed well right up until a day ago. It has completely died and no computer or tablet I have will recognize it. Under windows it now comes up as an unformatted removable drive. I have tried formatting it using FAT, NTSF and FATex. It can't be formatted. The drive is defective and hangs if I attempt to access it in any way. Long term quality is seriously flawed. I don't know if this is typical of this product or not, however, I have some SanDisk flash drives that are over 10 years old that still have their data and file structure intact. Perhaps, SanDisk is losing it's shine.</review-text>

		<review-text>I don't give less because it is impossible. I brought this because it is SanDisk, boy was I suprise when I open one of the three package I ordered. The product looks like it was made by a cheap plastic very fragile, it doesn't enter smoothly into a computer port. You could snap it with your own fingers...it doesn't give the impression that data could be saved safely on it. I regret buying three of them, when for a few more bucks I could have brought PNY.</review-text>

		<review-text>I just wanted to quickly say that this device has a cool design. It appears to be two very solid pieces of plastic, lacking the typical metal part that you'd insert into the USB port. As a result, it's very light. I like the colors. I do wish that it had some kind of LED light indicator, but not a big deal.

I DO recommend to people who use this to reformat it prior to use. I tried to use this in my car, and it was unrecognized, despite being FAT32. I reformatted the entire disk to FAT32, and then it worked without a problem.

Be warned that this device is so small and light, that you definitely run the risk of losing it in your bag or pockets. I highly recommend attaching something to the lanyard slot.</review-text>

		<review-text>16GB for 12 dollars?! I clicked away. Only to realize it was not USB 2.0 it's so incredibly slow it hurts so I never use it. And even when I have a lot of time to transfer it clogs up my computer and FCP won't even work. Do not buy spend the extra money on a faster drive.</review-text>

		<review-text>Functionally, it's fine. I bought it to transfer files between laptops at work and it was there I encountered the 4 gigabyte limitation on FAT formatted file systems as I was trying to transfer a 9 GB database backup. I realize that it's the most common format, but I shouldn't have to ask an IT guy for suggestions as to why I can't transfer a 9 GB file on my 32 GB Drive. Obviously, formatting it to NTFS made it work, but since they're putting plenty of other files on the drive would it have been so hard to put a readme.txt file saying that its FAT formatted?</review-text>

Only thing I think is missing is that it could also come with a keychain attachment string.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is pen drive is 100% plastic. Even the piece you insert in a computer is made out of plastic and it looks super fragile. As soon as I got this product in my hands I thought of returning it but Amazon's return shipping cost is almost 45% of my order so I decided to keep them.

It is also super slow on Write operations and I was only able to get 20Mb/s on Reads.

		<review-text>This is absolutely by far and away the slowest flash drive that I have ever used. I have owned may flash drives since they came on the scene and this is so slow i cant even use it. It is an absolute waste of your money unless you just want a very small flash drive. I have never posted a review before on any product that I have purchased on Amazon but I just had to on this one. I an actually writing this post as i wait on a 1GB file to copy from my computer to this drive and it said it would take 16 minutes. Well i took the time to write this review while I was waiting. I have finished the review and the file is not even close to being finished. Dont waste your money.</review-text>

		<review-text>Caution! Don't Buy!

This Flash Drive is just a piece of crap period. I saved multiple files folders with pictures of my daughter and important files and SanDisk corrupted them all. Their encryption software is even worse. I'm kicking myself that I used it with password protection. Now because they have known bug in that software I can not event get to my corrupted folder an files. This company is a JOKE, I was under impression that they sell quality products, but I guess now they only sell this total crap!

So, if you want your files to just get all screwed up - buy it, otherwise stay away from this toxic s#$@!</review-text>

		<review-text>I've had mine for years now, not purchased through Amazon but I thought I'd give my two bits here after reading some of the reviews (please read my other reviews on some other flash drives to get somewhat of an idea if you're curious).
Here's, boiled down to a very generic level, what you really need in one of these things;
Store and transfer your stuff
Remain dependable

ANY of these drives could stop working at the drop of a hat, that's just the world we live in. Buyer beware on absolutely everything, all the time. Maybe in the 50's it was different, but we ain't in the 50's no more.

So bottom line here, this drive is small, tough and slow. I have done nothing but use this thing almost every day for music and movies at home and in cars. I have not babied it in anyway and it rattles around in my front pocket with change and whatever else might be in there. It's been dropped God knows how many times, through the wash a few times and left out in the sun to dry off after finding it in my shorts getting out of a pool. I think I've just explained my experiences about its toughness and durability.
It has no problem playing HD movies or FLAC files in real time, so say what you will about how slow download times are, and they are, but it's never had a problem keeping up reading those files. EVER.
So if you can find something to do while your info is loading on to the drive, maybe read and finish a Stephen King novel, re-enact the Civil War or build a mini Vatican City out of popsicle sticks, then hopefully you'll have the same luck I have with this thing. There really isn't a smaller device (HP v165w, but that thing heats up big time and HAS trouble with HD movies) for the capacity and the price. Seriously.</review-text>

		<review-text>I bought one each of the 16GB and 8GB drives during a Cyber Monday deal. So far I've only opened the 16GB. I was in serious need of a larger drive for using as a portable test server. Transfer speed wasn't really an issue for me, so long as I could edit and test my PHP and other files using it. It also needed to work with several different operating systems. My laptop uses Windows XP, my desktop uses Windows Vista, and the college computers use Windows 7. I rely on my laptop and desktop on a daily basis.

First, the appealing and other good bits:
- 16GB in size. So that's 14.9GB of actual, available storage space.
- Small in physical size. Seriously, I think it redefines &quot;THUMB drive.&quot;
- Small hole at end for attaching a strap or keyring.
- Worked fine for copying some files from a school computer (Win7) to my desktop at home (Vista) as its debut usage.

Next, the so-so bits:
- Only way to distinguish between sizes is to check the small print on the back. I recommend color-coding any strap or keyring you attach if you have multiples.
- No cap or other form of protection for when not in use. May want to consider some sort of case if need be.
- No LED indicator light. Normally not an issue for me, but would be nice in this case given the issues I'm having.

And finally, the not so appealing bits. Or, &quot;Why This Item Only Gets Two Stars.&quot;

If I was only using this for one device as extra storage, I'd be very pleased given the price at which I bought the drive. Maybe even 5-stars pleased. But for the purpose for which I actually needed it, and the whole point to buying it in the first place? That would be a 1 or no stars. See, what I was not aware of is a new Windows practice/standard apparently going into effect with some newer flash drives. In short, and from what articles I've had the (quickly fading) patience to read, this new practice means the new drives themselves are now recognized as LOCAL DISKS, not REMOVABLE DISKS like they had been for years.

While Vista and above are okay with this, my XP system--the laptop I fully depend on when traveling or am otherwise away from my desk, and have no plans to retire in the immediate future--has no clue what to do with it. The drive doesn't show under My Computer, Disk Management doesn't acknowledge it, Device Manager thinks it notices something resembling a drive but refuses to enable it, and all around it's just plain unusable at present. Which especially stinks when I see Windows XP listed as being a compatible operating system on the back of the packaging. Several hours of online forum scouring later, and I may be only marginally closer (if even that much) to finding a solution. From the looks of things, I'll have to install one or more freeware programs on my desktop to even make an attempt. I've tried reformatting twice now, with no change.

And so, at the time of writing this review, and four days of trying to work with it, I give this device 2 stars: 5 stars for storage size, price (when on sale), and usability as a stationary storage device; -3 stars for hassle and lack of compatibility as a portable device. If a solution is found, I'll edit this review to reflect that change. I may even add a star or two, depending on how easy or complicated the solution is.</review-text>

		<review-text>I first added some files that contained passwords and other personal information. That information was stored on the drive. When I tried to download it to another computer, the Cruzer Blade and it's contents were invisible to it and all computers I tried to use it on. It simply stopped working and wasn't recognized as even being plugged into the USB drives.
Sandisk doesn't even have drivers on it's website for this one. All message board chat indicates wide-spread, same problems.
I can't return it for a refund because those files may still be on there and someone may be able to see them somehow.</review-text>

		<review-text>it comes to about 3.72 g. this is not abnormal for storage devices, however a 4g should be 4g. with the high end ones 16g+, they are new enough that the storage may be lacking so they just round up. 4g is old enough and cheap enough that they should have no problem to fill that. like many people i use 4g flash drives to run os/program installs on. 4g should be 4g.</review-text>

		<review-text>I have previously received the wrong item (4GB Falsh instead of the 16 GB I ordered and paid for). I abtained an RMA# and did return it to CTC Store (also at my cost) 1st class with mail delivery confirmation. I did get confirmation by USPS that it was delivered to CTC Store.

I tried to check the staus on when they would ship the CORRECT 16GB flash drive to me, but they kept claiming they did not have it yet and would have to vsiit the post office to see if it was there. I felt I was being stalled and I was not happy. I had USPS delivery confirmation that it was returned to them!

I did end up reporting this to Amazon.com, and it seemed that only then did things start moving along. I did finaly get the correct item and it seems to work just great. CTC STore needs to take care that what they pack really matches what was ordered and what was on the packing slip! A more timelier RMA process would e great too!</review-text>

		<review-text>The minute I pulled the drive out of it's packaging, I noticed how flawed the keyhole feature was. I was just barely big enough to fit my (standard sized) keyring through, but allowed it no flexibility. The whole reason I chose this drive over some others was for it's sleek look and the ability to throw it on my keys and bring it with me anywhere. Well, two months after putting it on the ring, as I had begun to suspect would happen, the regular use of my keyring and the flash drive had caused the plastic hole through which it was threaded to split open. Now it won't go on my ring anymore and to me is useless right now.

As a drive, it does the job just fine. As a keyring accessory, it sucks. Purchase accordingly.</review-text>

I have several other drives i use for in car music and none of them have any of these problems. First, every time i shut off the engine i have to remove the drive, and plug it back in to even get it to recognize it's there which in my opinion is completely unacceptable. I have also notice some skipping when i try to change tracks. I bought this usb drive because most of them have lights which are very annoying when driving at night. Bottom line, if you are getting this for a car, get something else instead.</review-text>

		<review-text>I purchased this flash drive to create a recovery disk or storage, that requires 15.6 GB memory, for a recently purchased netbook. I wrongly assumed that 16 GB was greater than 15.6 GB. I found out just how much 16GB is when I accessed the flash drive, and it only had 14.6 GB memory available.

It is a very compact and solidly built flashdrive with great storage of 32GB on the go, and available at a great price as well. Another nice feature is that this SanDisk Cruzer flashdrive does not have a flashdrive cap, which is great for not having to worry about misplacing and losing it.

		<review-text>Mine arrived with the plastic USB connection part squashed flat enough that it wouldn't fit into USB ports until I heated it up and formed it back into a rectangular shape. Be aware these seem to be made of some really cheap plastic and the port end has no metal reinforcement to keep its shape.

Once I repaired it, I managed to get it to squeeze into its intended port (a Roku TV, for live TV recording) and there it will stay, simply because I don't want to have to struggle with it again. I would absolutely NOT recommend this model for anyone who wants a portable, frequently plugged-in-and-removed flash drive. If, however, you need a flash drive that will sit in a USB port semi-permanently, this is a good value... As long as you take care when you first try to use it.

Three stars. It's Okay, but it's definitely built cheaply.</review-text>

		<review-text>USB drives should not be used to store your only copy of anything important. From reviews I've read, regardless of brand and model, there seems to be an acceptable(?) fail rate on USB drives. I guess I've been lucky until now - haven't had any failure for the past 10 years, and I've had Sandisks and PNY drives. This failed after about 2 weeks of infrequent use. I backed up about 20G of data from my old laptop with a USB 2.0 port. Plugged it into my new laptop with USB 3.0 and have been using it to do daily backups of my working files for the past 2 weeks. This thing was fast on both laptops and I was really happy until it failed today. Took about 5 minutes for my computer to even register that the drive was there. I could see the folders, but couldn't navigate into them. After fussing with it for 30 minutes, I gave up.

I reformatted the drive (FAT format for faster performance) and it seems to work again. Of course, I lost all data on it when I reformatted. Luckily I had a copy of the drive on another USB drive (PNY) elsewhere. I copied all the data back on and it seems to work fine.

One reviewer had said that he believes some of these may be corrupt past a certain point on the drive. If that is so, then I'm looking at around the 21G mark. I'll have to see if that is my issue. I'll repost if I find that that is the case. In the meantime, I've copied all of my files back on and things are working.</review-text>

		<review-text>This USB thumb drive does what it is supposed to do. It is a good value. A couple things to know:
(1) It has a plastic rather than metal USB housing. When first inserted it was a very snug fit.
(2) It only has a 2-year warranty, compared to a 5-year warranty for SanDisk's more solid lines.
(3) Apparently it is USB 2.0, but very little documentation comes with it.
(4) It has a spot for a lanyard, but does not come with an actual lanyard.
(5) Amazon's recyclable frustration-free packaging is a pleasant alternative to the don't-rip-this-off packaging.</review-text>

		<review-text>I picked up several of these recently at the local big-box store (they were on sale). The 32GB thumb drives are formatted Fat32 and have approximately 29.1GB of free space on them - there is a small amount of space being used for the folder for the SanDisk Secure Access software and the PDF manuals for it. I don't plan on using the software, so I just deleted it. These are USB 2.0 devices, so not the fast thing out there - but for carrying around documents and some photos they work fine. Back of the package states that these drives will work with Windows Vista ~ Windows 10, and Mac OS X. I'm still running a Windows 7 Pro machine at home, and have an old laptop running Vista, and using a Win10 machine at work and haven't had any issues with using these thumb drives so far. The outer shell of these drives is plastic, so you might not want to use these while rock climbing or any other activity where there is a chance of them getting knocked around - at home or in the office they should be fine.</review-text>

		<review-text>This USB drive has an all plastic body. I have no problem with this, but thought it might be useful to know, especially because it's not quite what I was expecting myself. As such I think it has a bit of a cheap feel to it. It's extremely light weight, not that this is bad. I just prefer the more solid feel of other SanDisk USB drives that I have.

This item looks and feels smallish, but the wide plastic body might not play nice with another USB device plugged in next to it, if the USB ports are very close together. Just something to keep in mind.

I've owned many SanDisk USB drives and have never had any problems with any of them.</review-text>

		<review-text>I am using 2 of these in a mirror configuration for a FreeNAS machine with this little low power mobo. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JMQ1V24 They seem to have acceptable write speeds and I would say slighlty above average cheap USB flash drive reads. They are faster than the 4GB Patriot USB flash drive I had laying around.

Anyway they have been running for about a week now. If any of them fail prematurely I'll update my review. FreeNAS is designed to run off USB flash drives though so they should in theory last quite a long time. They otherwise seem pretty solid for the price.</review-text>

		<review-text>USB flash drives are incredibly slow. This one is around 6 to 7 MB/s when writing to it. You get much higher speeds when reading. The write speed on this is faster than ones I bought years ago but half the speed of the larger SanDisk drives. By larger I mean physical size not memory size. This drive is very tiny. It is going to be used for songs in my car. The plastic jack makes it hard to insert into the USB slot. Do not buy if you need to be writing to it often or to be inserting it into USB slots often.</review-text>

		<review-text>This flash drive is as quick as you would expect at this price point, so no complaints there. I just needed a cheap drive to be able to move some files around when I am offline.

I should have read the reviews before buying this drive though, because the pictures in the description give absolutely no sense of how microscopic this drive is. Take for example the Cruzer Glide retractable drive, which when compared next to each other in their Amazon descriptions look like they are identically sized. This is only about 1.5 inches long and dark colored, so it is not easy to find on a darker carpet.

Overall I am satisfied with this flash drive, although I would have purchased a larger model if I had realized how small this would be.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is an excellent little drive -- I've used my black and red Cruzer as a live USB, as file storage, etc. for 3 years now after finding it on sale, and it still works today! It reads and writes decently, and I'm still happy with it. Unlike the really long, annoying drives (Glide) or the equally good (but small) Ultra Fit, this one is a &quot;medium-sized&quot; drive that doesn't stick out too much and yet is also portable enough to not bump it (and hurt the port) as much as the larger ones. I'd definitely recommend this little drive to anyone.</review-text>

		<review-text>Very small and light and would get lost easily, but they do have a hole to put a key chain ring. Had to reformat them because they come in FAT32, and reformatting blows away the little SanDick vault program they came with. FAT32 is not a big deal, unless your are trying to save really big back-up files larger than 4 GB like we are. Once reformatted (takes like 5 seconds) they are fine for our back-up purposes.</review-text>

Then after holding for about 8 years you get a person who can barely speak English and has no clue so you eventually just hang up out of frustration.Maybe I should learn some languages other than English so I can deal with Sandisk.The reason these are priced so low is that they are KNOWINGLY selling a defective product (just google) and by making the tech support impossible to deal with they know you'll eventually give up,throw it in the trash and hopefully forget in a few years and accidentally buy from them.Don't do it and let's all boycott this scam company.</review-text>

The end of the flash drive that you insert into your computer is made out of plastic also and quite fragile; with enough weight on it, appears it can break. I have always bought Sandisk flash drives, but the build quality of this drive is inferior to ones I've bought in the past.

Maybe not, but I sure like the drives that are made of solid aluminum much better than these cheap, plastic guys. That being said, They are durable: I have dropped them, tried to poke them into USB slots the wrong way, and generally man handled the little buggers. So far, they haven't dropped a byte of data.
So, I guess if it is just up to aesthetics, if the dollar or two makes a difference to you, let that be your guide as to whether to get these as opposed to something in a pleasing metallic hue.</review-text>

Pros:

3)No cap. If there was one and it is lost, then it will really be a problem. But this one doesn't have one. So good
4)It's a Sandisk
5)Good Transfer Speed. I get about 19 to 20Mbps. Those who complain about low transfer speed, try formatting the pen drive from FAT32 to NTFS to increase the speed. At FAT32 I only get about 5 to 6Mbps while in NTFS, as I have mentioned above about 19 to 20Mbps
6) I like the Sandisk Secure Access Software

Cons:
1)Only 14.9 gigs of storage.(But can live with it!)
2)Average Build Quality.

But the Cons are outweighed by the benefits of this product.

Note:
Pls DONT format this pen drive to NTFS from FAT32, it will be ruined..!

The Pen Drive has an average write speed of about 6 Mbps and reading speed of about 18-20 Mbps running on FAT32 . As few other reviewers have told please DONT format your pen drive to NTFS as this will effect the Cruzer Blade's performance in a negative way! Previously I had the same pen drive (Cruzer Blade 16GB itself) which i had purchased from SP Road but after reading the misleading reviews out here i formatted it and the magnificent pen drive became ridiculous. The write speed became 3.5 Mbps but the read speed was not affected. Even after reformatting it to its original FAT32 format from NTFS, the read and write speed remained horribly the same.So kindly DONT format it to NTFS.

USB 1.1 PORT =(speed)= Upto 2.0 Mbps transfer rate
USB 2.0 PORT =(speed)= Upto 11.0 Mbps transfer rate</review-text>

		<review-text>hello,
sandisk makes great sd cards and flash drives. they are one of the original flash drive companies back in the early days. this one was purchased as a minimal size drive for transferring a ton of photos and videos. the web services were not to our liking and we want to control our own data. most drives are the standard 3/4 x 2 1/2 with caps or slide outs for connections. this one has an unusual shape that allows you to grip it well. also, it stands out on your desk or in a drawer among all of the other standard sized flash drives. for a simple unusual looking flash drive with the sandisk quality, this is the one to have. 4gb was plenty for many photos and videos to transfer. great drive and fast delivery...</review-text>

The deal breaker
(x) Failed within 3 months of purchase

Overall: One star. The form factor may be decent, but the lack of standard features found in most other USB flash drives, slow performance and personal experience of drive failure makes it difficult to find redeeming factors

Note: This review is based on the 16GB version

I needed a simple, large capacity flash drive to replace my 8GB one. This SanDisk 16GB Cruzer Blade fit the bill. It's a one-piece design so there's no need to fiddle around with caps or retracting mechanisms and it's made of plastic so it won't scratch other items as easily when placed in the bag. At first glance, there's little to find fault with, using it however, is another story.

The first thing I noticed when using this device is the extremely tight fit to the USB port. I could barely push the USB head in and I thought I was going to break my laptop port. Initially, I thought I had inserted it in the wrong orientation, but nope, it's just the tight fit of the Cruzer Blade.

After the troublesome insertion, the second thing struck; no activity indicator light. May I ask why? My 8GB flash drive that this Cruzer Blade replaced has one, my next SanDisk flash drive that replaced this Cruzer Blade has one, even my flash drives of the long past have one, so why is it missing on this particular model?

If you look at Amazon's illustrations, you'll find that there's an opening on the end of the Cruzer Blade for attaching a strap. SanDisk should have just accommodated a small indicator light there while leaving enough room for an attached strap. This is important because without an activity indicator, there's no visually easy way to find out whether the flash drive is connected or working properly. So is my PC still attempting to access the Cruzer Blade or was it not connected securely? I don't know and I never will.

When I tried to transfer files over to the Cruzer Blade, the rates were hard to swallow. Most of the time, I get 5 - 6 MB/s; on a very rare occasion, I may experience 7 MB/s. In comparison, a good USB 2.0 drive would get 9 - 11 MB/s; the fastest I've seen personally was 13 MB/s.

Even if I could tolerate all those above, only three months after purchase, the Cruzer Blade decided to just start failing on me and I could extract barely half of the files stored on it before it was completely unreadable. I attempted to reformat it, but Windows could never complete the format. What I have now is just a tiny piece of plastic that can't even serve as a decent paperweight.

I could claim a warranty on this device, but I'd rather just purchase another model rather than deal with all the design flaws and slow transfer rates again. Furthermore, for a few more dollars, there exist USB 3.0 capable flash drives with the same capacity. This Cruzer Blade almost made me avoid the SanDisk brand altogether, but I was once again tempted by the 16GB SanDisk Ultra USB 3.0 (SanDisk Ultra CZ48 16GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive Transfer Speeds Up To 100MB/s-SDCZ48-016G-UAM46) sold on discount at a store. Check out my review on that to find out how it fares as a replacement.

		<review-text>...my only concern is how durable it's going to prove. The featherweight quality is made possible by all-plastic construction, including the actual USB plug-in part which my index finger was able to press a fair bit into; hopefully that flex will not increase with time and get torn, warped, bent, etc. Especially since I've decided to attach this thing to my keychain, so it will come into contact with the metal edges of all my keys on a constant basis.

Also hope that over time, dust and dirt will not get into the plug and short out the circuits inside. Otherwise I am quite happy with this baby...it looks good and feels good in my hands, and data transfer feels fairly quick.

It was easy to simply erase all the Sandisk software on this device and then reformat the entire thing before first use. For some reason it only allows the FAT32 format not the NTFS format...hopefully this will not make any difference. I just thought that FAT32 is more likely to get corrupted if you pull it out of a computer without first right clicking &quot;eject&quot; on the flash drive's desktop icon.

Will update in a few weeks/months if anything unusual occurs...</review-text>

		<review-text>I cannot believe how poorly these are constructed. I guess you get what you pay for. But seriously, Sandisk used to be a good company, what happened? there is absolutely no metal on it; all plastic. It feels like it will break when you touch it.

		<review-text>The Blade....Finally a USB drive that's quickly recognized, quickly loaded and durable in materials and design. Sandisk has made the majority of my external memory &quot;cards&quot; and I bet you, they just put one of them in this sleek, tough little plastic drive.
The cool thing is that the drive is ALL ONE PIECE, in other words, there's no cap, and there's no &quot;metal&quot; USB lodged in a plastic case...Which can be affected by static discharges, and loosen in the plastic...
The contacts of the Blade are protected by being recessed INSIDE the plastic 'mouth' of the drive.
Fits FINE in my Mini 9's USB ports.
Has a satisfying 'weight' (if you can call a few grams weighty) without being noticeable in a pocket - WATCH OUT you people who wash clothes with money in the pockets, satisfy yourself you will also wash this drive and I am not testing that out....
I put mine on a lanyard (not included) and it's on my neck.
16GB is what I bought, at well below the 'going rate' right now, for 16GB storage.
I got 1,400+ songs in 326kb quality on the thing. Oh, and of course some movies. Ha ha ha.
So all-in-all I like it very much and applaud Sandisk on producing this most-savory USB drive with, FINALLY, intelligent design and construction.

Enjoy

Note on drive failure described for representative pieces of every USB drive sold on Amazon: ALL USB drives are subject to potential corruption, rendering them permanently unidentifiable on your machine. You read reviews all the time about a drive &quot;suddenly not working&quot; which can be true memory failure but as often, is a halfway &quot;safely remove hardware&quot; glitch due to an I/O error. It just happens.</review-text>

		<review-text>Flash drive works as advertised. I bought flash drive to store music on and listen to it in my car stereo system. It seemed like when I transferred my music from my documents to the flash drive, it took longer than I expected. also when I plug it into my cat stereo, it takes a minute or two for my stereo to read the drive. I have used other sandisk flash drives on same stereo and they read quicker. Now with this being said, the flash drive was and is a great price which is a big plus. It also holds a lot of data and the drive is very small which makes it easy to carry around or keep in your pocket. I would highly recommend this flash drive if someone is using it for backup or occasional use. If it is a flash drive that you read and write to daily, then you might want to go with a regular Sandisk cruzer instead of the Sandisk cruzer blade. I am giving this three stars because the product did work as advertised but just not as fast as I thought a 2.0 USB flash drive should work.</review-text>

		<review-text>These are perfect for storing and playing music on usb friendly media devices. That's because they're so small (about half the length of an average thumb or thumb drive as it were. Less protrusion from your device means less chance of accidental contact and damage to either. Although made from plastic, they seem fairly sturdy. I haven't counted how many tunes can be stored on one of these;suffice to say, it's a lot (even using wav files). My only complaint is that they're slow to write to, hence only four stars.

Update - 2/4/16

Took off a star due to a new discovery. Since I run though my Flash drives with a fairly heavy workload (some acting as Linux Boot Drives), I format and clean them frequently to ensure that I've always got a large amount of space for data backup and other miscellaneous projects. It was when I formatted this specific drive in FAT32 - the same format it came on - for the third time upon receiving this drive that I noticed that something wasn't quite right.

2 Gigabytes was missing. This isn't a make-or-break scenario for me with this drive, as I've recently repurposed it for school projects and personal projects. Perhaps it really is from heavy wear-and-tear, as flash chips do reduce the amount of space in total, though it should be mentioned.</review-text>

		<review-text>I purchased the 16GB version. As tested with ATTO, this drive has the dubious distinction of being the slowest drive I have EVER purchased in the last 10 years. The average writes are 2.5MB/s. Average read speeds are 27MB/s. I tried different formatting types and different allocation unit sizes in the format to no avail. Other people have mentioned that its slow and I didn't believe it could be THAT slow. It is. I gave it two stars because it was so cheap. But its going to waste more of my time than its worth.</review-text>

		<review-text>Per the advertisement for this SanDisk USB drive it states that you can:

• “Share your photos, videos, songs and other files between computers with ease”

However, that advertised statement is false!

I purchased the 32GB SanDisk USB drive to copy a video I took at a baby shower. I read the description advertised and ordered it so that I could have the video ready ASAP for the mother-to-be. The video turned out to be only 13GB, however the USB drive says that this file is too large to copy the video file. I tried several different methods - including re-formatting the drive - to copy the video onto it, but to no avail. Then I noticed in another review that another buyer had issues with this drive being able to accommodate video files as well. I believe this item as advertised is misleading. If you’re looking to ever store any video or similarly sized files to this SanDisk drive, I 100% DO NOT recommend this particular USB drive.

Worth noting, I’ve used other SanDisk drives over the years and didn’t have any trouble with copying any files as long as they were smaller than the USB drive capacity. That too should be the case for this latest USB drive, as I ordered it with more than plenty space to store this video. I believe that SanDisk manufactures quality memory drives, but this one just didn't fit the bill.</review-text>

		<review-text>It works, more than I can say for some flash drives I have bought. Not sure what else to say about a flash drive. I am sure there are some specs someone more techy than me could give about the drive but the main thing is it works, you put files from your computer on it, plug it into something else and they are still there. The only &quot;problem&quot; I can find is it is small and sometimes I have a hard time finding it in my purse. But at the same time that is one of the reasons I like it, it is small, it takes up less room than a mini bic lighter which is great if you are traveling. And since no one wants to pay to check luggage every tiny bit of space counts.</review-text>

		<review-text>$5.00 for a 16 gb flash drive was an easy choice. It worked when I plugged it into the usb 2.0 port in my desktop tower and when I moved files to and from it relatively fast, which that's all I can really ask for and need in a usb flash drive. If you're prone to losing these things, it also comes has a small hole that you can loop into a keychain if you need to keep track of it. It doesn't come with a cap or anything similar like a usb thumb drive, but that's fine as long as you're not the type of person to throw usb flash drives full force at a wall or drop them off of very tall buildings. Last thing, this flash drive appears to come with the Sandisk SecureAccess installer on the drive itself (which I haven't bothered using) and based on the Sandisk's website, is supposed to encrypt your flash drive for those people who want that extra layer of protection.</review-text>

		<review-text>Avoid this product at all times. It seems like a good deal getting 16GB for $5 or less at many stores. However, the USB case and connector are flimsy, made of cheap, bendable plastic, and will easily break. Imagine storing important information on your USB drive only to have the case or USB connector break such that you can't read your data. What good is the stored data if you can't read it?

This device is so cheaply made that it was even difficult to plug it into a USB connector on the computer because of the bad dimensional tolerances and materials used for the connector on the USB drive.

I can't stress this enough: Avoid this product. Make sure the USB connector portion of any USB device you buy is made of metal.

Spend a couple extra dollars for a better constructed USB drive now and avoid headaches and heartbreak in the future.</review-text>

		<review-text>When I lost my old Sansa I went looking for a new flashdrive. After reading dozens of reviews I chose this one. Yes, as numerous others have noted, it is slow; however, that is a price I am willing to pay for the superior reliability over many of its competitors. In addition to reliability, the size and price are right. At the time I purchased it, there were few competitors with a 16GB drive for under $15; for that price you can't really go wrong. Also, it is small enough that I was able to attach a braid to the built-in loop and attach it to my keys. It fits in my pocket without taking up any noticeably more room and I always have it with me when I need to get a file. I have had it for 6+ months now and it has worked great.

Update 14AUG2013:
Well, after owning this flash drive for almost a year it has bit the dust. It was never abused and always rode in my pocket. It went out slowly, first not working in my desktop and then becoming more and more finicky about which computer it would work in. Eventually, it was pointless to carry because it was failing to function in more computers than it worked in. As a result, I don't feel I can justify more than two stars and am adjusting my rating down from the original four stars. I have replaced it with Kingston Digital DataTraveler SE9 16GB USB 2.0 DTSE9H/16GBZ that has a fully metal case, is cheaper than the Blade, and is made to slip right onto a key ring - no strings, cords, or braiding required. I will provide a review of that product when I have had a chance to put it through the paces.</review-text>

		<review-text>Transferring onto it is kinda slow I guess. So if you're a spy or something, you might want to look at what they use in the movies instead. I'm using a couple of these connected to my car stereos to play mp3s and videos. It takes a minute for the stereo to read it all at start up, but I don't notice any hesitation afterward when scanning albums and playing songs. Video played fine from it as well. The whole thing is plastic and not a very strong feeling one, but I don't foresee it bending or breaking like other sliding ones I've had. In my case it will be spending all its time in the glove box, so it's not an issue, but I'm not sure how long it would last being thrown around, sat on, etc. So if you're not a spy that needs speed and case that can deflect bullets, this cheap flash drive is a goody buy.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is a very small flash drive:

1 5/8 inches long x 11/16 inches wide x 5/16 inches high

This small size allows these drives to be placed side by side, even when the USB ports are very close together. The small size also means that it is just that much easier to lose (or be stolen). At the back of it there is a hole that will allow you to connect it to a string or a strap.

A big drawback for me is the absence of an LED. Without this LED, you will not be sure when it is active, You will get no direct feedback from this Flash drive.

The manufacturer has deliberately omitted the read and write speeds of this drive. That is because they know that it can be a slow poke at times.

In making your purchasing decision, these are the key issues:

- Price (not the cheapest)
- Size (the smallest, but no LED)
- Speed (pretty slow)</review-text>

		<review-text>I have a half dozen flashdrives, mostly Kingston with one Iomega and one Lexar. I was tempted to try this Sandisk because of the 4GB capacity and the &quot;giveaway&quot; pricing.

My only problem was the tight fit in the USB socket. For whatever reason inserting it caused my XP computer to reboot. Since that happened, there have been no incidents.

Especially impressive is the tiny size of the device. I use a front USB port for it and have always been nervous that my previous 3 inch Kingston drive would get hit and damage the USB socket. That worry went away with this drive. It's next to a USB printer cord and the drive is actually shorter than the plug portion of that cord.

I checked performance knowing that this drive would not be especially fast. My Kingston wrote at a speed of 112MB per minute. A test file of 324MB wrote to the Sandisk in 1min 15sec for a rate of 281MB per minute. It reads at about 1GB per minute. These are not record-breaking numbers but are way ahead of many flashdrives, especially at this price point.

I'm not thrilled at not having a protective end cap, but this shouldn't present an issue to me. I tend to keep the drive installed at all times and use it as a utility storage area to hold temporary files. Examples are internet downloads and graphics I'm working on. I don't use this drive for portability to other computers. If I did, I would likely put it in a pants or shirt pocket away from my key ring. However, the hole in its end could accommodate a lanyard (doesn't come with one) and I doubt very much if the plastic &quot;loop&quot; would break. Seems to be pretty tough stuff.

Seems like one of the better buys out there in the electronics world. The reviews at Amazon and on Staples web site (1200 reviews at 4+ stars) would agree with this.

A real no-brainer to try one.

		<review-text>A lot of reviews who rated this item highly liked for reasons I would consider either irrelevant or actual drawbacks:

1. There's no cap to lose... but there's no cap to protect the plug from whatever might get into it

2. It's tiny... but Kingston makes one much smaller

3. It can go through the wash... but don't reasonably intelligent people check their pockets before tossing a garment into the wash? (This flash drive may survive a washing but a $10,000 check from Uncle Louie won't.)

I only bought this item (not from Amazon) because I needed it fast and the store didn't carry Kingston. Sandisk was the only brand they had that I would trust.

It works fine, but I still like Kingston better.

As I see it the only thing this drive does that Kingston doesn't do is that it has its own encryption software, but you can always encrypt your files before putting them on the drive. And it offers optional online storage with a company called Yuu Waa. If you think your data is safer in Yuu Waa's cloud than in your hand, that's your business.

I've been using Kingston's DataTraveler for years (the old fashioned kind with the cap, not the newer ones with the hinged cover.) So far I've never had one fail, though all drives fail eventually. I've never put one through the wash or actually submerged it, but I have had them get very wet from a spray of water (without the cap on) and they survived. For my money... buy a Kingston.</review-text>

	<review id="2603">
		<review-text>This is a very small flash drive:

1 5/8 inches long x 11/16 inches wide x 5/16 inches high

This small size allows these drives to be placed side by side, even when the USB ports are very close together. The small size also means that it is just that much easier to lose (or be stolen). At the back of it there is a hole that will allow you to connect it to a string or a strap.

A big drawback for me is the absence of an LED. Without this LED, you will not be sure when it is active, You will get no direct feedback from this Flash drive.

The manufacturer has deliberately omitted the read and write speeds of this drive. That is because they know that it can be a slow poke at times.

In making your purchasing decision, these are the key issues:

- Price (not the cheapest)
- Size (the smallest, but no LED)
- Speed (pretty slow)</review-text>

		<review-text>Pros: Burst speeds, great. I currently have a linux distro on this USB stick and I am impressed. This drive has amazing burst performance. I've already accidently run over this drive once and it went through the laundry once, still works even though this doesn't have a cover over the port.

Cons: Sustained file transfer speed is horrible. Similar to others that I've noticed with most USB hard drives, once you get ones larger capacity USB drives (over 4 gigs) sustained speed for transfers larger than 200 MB take about 1 minute per 200MB. This drive never gets warm under heavy use so maybe the limiting of speed is due to heat protection .

If you want a simple little USB drive that you can put a live linux distro on, look no further. Just know that this USB drive doesn't have a cap so junk can get caught inside the port. Given how indestructible this little bugger can be I don't think you really need any type of cover on it. One complaint I have heard are my friends worried about loosing it because it is so tiny. I bought this drive because I've had many sandisk drives in the past which have always been flawless. I currently have one of the sliding designs and I don't like that one nearly as much as this tiny little beauty.</review-text>

		<review-text>Bought 3 (from another vendor) and they do exactly what I'd expect a USB2.0 drive of this price point to do. I do however take issue with the advertised size and the actual size.

Advertised capacity: 16,000,000,000 bytes
Actual capacity: 15,631,122,432
Difference: 368,877,568 bytes -or- 351.789MiB

Over 3 drives I lose out on 1,106,632,704 bytes -or- 1.03GiB

Every other flash drive I own (except a freebie promotional 2GB) give slightly more than the advertised capacity.</review-text>

		<review-text>Now while I admit, I did not buy this product from amazon. I did purchase this item from a local store (from the Caribbean) and after testing it out, I felt compelled to educate you all about this device.

Now of the bat, the goods are that the device is small, sturdy and doesn't feel flimsy at all. It seems that it can stand up to a bit of punishment. The security software is okay for moderate protection, obviously don't go using it for wallstreet stock options secrets heh.

One concern is that the contact head is exposed so might be prone to damage if you are not careful. But its small size, means it may not damage if it falls.

The one thing I didn't like about this device probably is the most important of them all, the read/write speeds. Maybe its the bad luck with the one I bought, but this one, the read/write speeds are terrible. If you only intend to transfer small files then it's okay. But files that are larger than 100MB and if they are more than one, this is NOT the drive for you. Personally I would recommend the Kingston Datatraveller DT101-G2. This is MUCH faster USB 2.0 flash drive.</review-text>

		<review-text>I had this usb for the past 3 years now. I bought it first when I entered college and it still is in perfect working condition. The only reason I didn't rate a full 5 star is because the plastic that has the hole for the keychain is very fragile. Even though it broke off for me only recently after 3 years of use, I would have preferred to have it intact as I took great care of it.
Still, it is a really good product. I now carry it in my wallet since I can't attach it to the keychain anymore.</review-text>

		<review-text>The write of a single 161MB file took 24.5 seconds, which is about 6.6MB/sec involving a 4GB SanDisk Blade formatted as Mac OS Extended (journaled). USB transfer speed--besides the difference between 1.1/2.0/3/0--is largely dependent on the format type, file size, and processor speed (and what it is doing at the time).

I did another test on the same setup writing to the plastic (current version Cruzer and it took 40.5 seconds). This one is the stock MS-DOS format.
I did it again on the same plastic cruzer and it took 38.5 seconds. This one is formatted as Mac OS Extended (journaled).
Surprise. I wrote the same 161MB file to the old Cruzer (the black one that looks like the Cruzer Titanium) and it took only 16.5 seconds (MS-DOS format)

The write speed is on par with other inexpensive drives, but my finding tells me that the blade's write speed is above average and is anything but lackluster.

The read speed is lightning fast and I wouldn't even waste my time to do a test.

All tests conducted on MacBook Pro Core 2 Duo 2.5GHz.</review-text>

		<review-text>I was looking for a small drive to keep on my keychain. I purchased this one in April, but by midsummer, the plastic loop at the end of the drive had cracked, making it impossible to fasten to my key ring or anything really.

I'm lucky I din't loose it (It cracked while in my pocket). I'm going to attempt to have it replaced because it should still be under warranty. I hope they give me a different 16GB model. I wouldn't buy this one again.</review-text>

So, I got one of these things in the hopes that I could put it on my keychain and it wouldn't be bulky in my pocket. When it came in the mail I was not disappointed! This thing is TINY. Yes, it's plastic; no, it's not the fastest thumb drive in the world; and who knows, I might even sit on it one day and break it.. but for $23 and extra portability, I can deal with the speed and will wrap it in layers of duct tape to cushion it if I feel the need to.

		<review-text>I'm not sure where I bought this drive, but I've had it for years and I love it. I've kept it on my keychain (which I'm not gentle with) and it's never faltered. I'm not sure what the reviewer below is talking about it not being a USB 2.0 device. It is. What it's not is 3.0 compatible, which will only help you if you're using upgraded USB ports (they're usually blue instead of black). If you have upgraded USB ports then it's worth looking for a 3.0 compatible flash drive. If you don't, this is a dirt cheap option that's been bulletproof for me.

I love the small design and the fact it doesn't have a cap. Nothing to lose and minimal impact on my keychain.</review-text>

Not great but not bad either. In fact, I purchased another SanDisk thumb drive to replace it (SanDisk Ultra 16GB Dual Drive USB Type-C (SDDDC2-016G-G46)) and it is great!

		<review-text>It looks nice, light awesome design etc. What I appreciate is that this is one piece USB. I tend to lose caps or other parts that easily breaks. So far that where stars went to. Now performance hmm as previously said slow, slow and again slow. When transfering one file well speed is decent 20 up to 24 Mbit/s but if you have large multiple file selection it falls down to 2 to 4 Mbit/s. To make matter worse at end of every transfer it takes some 20 to 30 seconds to finish something even though transfer has been completed. So bottom line if you need fast USB this is not it :(. Maybe it is windows fault but since I am not the only one complaining about speed hmm...make sure you have taken all this into account prior to buying this USB.</review-text>

		<review-text>Bought the 16GB version for $7.99 from Amazon. I've used several other thumb-drives, and so just wanted to point out a few things about this one.

It is VERY SMALL and VERY LIGHT. I'd imagine this would be very easy to break (or at least lose). So, I put it on a small key-ring (yes it has a hole for that) then attached it to my primary keychain. There is NO cap on this, which is good for quick-access, but not-so-good for durability. It hasn't failed me yet, but then again... I've only had it for two days. ;)

It is one of the SLOWEST thumb-drives I've ever used. It isn't painfully slow or unusable, but it is definitely noticeably slower than other similarly-sized drives.

It has a password-protection software included on it. You can add files to a &quot;vault&quot;. This is actually a decent feature for such a low pricepoint.

Overall, it's a mediocre drive at a decent price point. There's not much more you can say about a USB Flash Drive.</review-text>

		<review-text>I bought mine at Wal-Mart for $5. 2 days later I go to the beach and forget the USB is in my shorts. I was terrified. I didn't use it for a day to let it dry. It worked perfectly. I have had no issues with it for about 2 years now. Amazing product</review-text>

		<review-text>Good compact flash drive. Transfer speeds are fast. Entire outside is plastic that feels cheap, but that doesn't affect performance. Great value if you just need some cheap portable storage. I have mine full of music that I keep in my car.</review-text>

		<review-text>When I first got this drive, it worked just fine. I loaded it with about 3GB of music videos and left it plugged into the front of my Blu-Ray player. Well, after a few months, all the videos at the end (the last ones put on the drive), wouldn't play. I plugged the drive back into my PC and they wouldn't play there either, I got an error in vlc saying they were corrupt. I had all the videos backed up elsewhere, so I formatted and copied them all on again. Same problem! The exact same videos wouldn't play. So i wiped the drive again, and copied just the videos that wouldn't play back onto the flash drive. Now they played perfectly, no problems. But when I moved the remainder of the files over, now a whole different group of files wouldn't play.

It appears everything copied onto the disk after approximately the 2GB mark gets corrupted. I tried formatting and copying data onto the drive from a desktop and two different laptops, all different brands and different chipsets (but all running Windows XP). No dice, problem is definitely the drive. It's formatted fat32, but the files I'm copying on there are between 10mb and 120mb. Not huge in the least, nowhere near the fat32 4gb limit.

Going to try a low-level format next, but this is really a bummer, as the drive was barely used at all, and only written to ONCE. The initial write was successful, it died after being READ maybe 40 or 50 times.</review-text>

		<review-text>I got a bunch of these because they're pretty cheap to plug music into car usb ports. After using these, they are the slowest usb I have ever used. For normal usage or anything other than putting passive pictures or music into a display device, get another usb. I would recommend if you have an electronic picture frame that loops pictures or if you are doing nothing but playing music from it. Copying music to or from is slow too though.</review-text>

		<review-text>The drive works fine and I like the indicator light, BUT you have to hold the slider part AND the outer case with one hand to keep the drive end from sliding back into the unit.

No problems so far with read and write functions. I dropped it accidentally on a concrete floor a couple of times but have not faced any drive fail issues so far.</review-text>

		<review-text>Bought this 16Gb thumbdrive without reading any review before, I was thinking I don't really care for the the fastest it cannot be very bad anyway.It is certainly the worst buy I've done in a while.
Average write speed is around 2-3Mb/s, which is ridiculous when you have 16Gb to fill up. Started to copy a backup of 10Gb, ETA: 40min.
This is unacceptable, I haven't seen such a speed in years maybe with USB 1.1, and as such the drive is completely unusable. To write small files you don't need 16Gb thumbdrive, stay away from this one.
What a waste.</review-text>

		<review-text>Promo advertised 16GB flashdrive for $4.49, but I was charged double that and got a type of flashdrive that I'm not familiar with (or want)

Do I just ship it back to return address? It says

Fulfillment Center

Miami, FL

And how does shipping get charged?

		<review-text>My SanDisk Cruzer Blade 16GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive has incredibly slow read/write speeds. Admittedly I did not do a thorough speed test, but it's taking me 30 minutes to transfer an 11 GB file. At first I thought it might the a problem with my computer as opposed to the flash drive so I tried a few different systems -- all with the same result.</review-text>

		<review-text>I was surprised at how small this travel stick was for holding 16 GB. It has a place to attach a cord so once I did that I feel it won't get lost so easy. My only con is there is no cover over the open USB end. I had previously purchased a Kingston travel stick and it sometimes was not recognized by my computer. This ScanDisk has no problem with that.</review-text>

		<review-text>So the plastic that surrounds the hole broke off within a few days. Could not use it with a ring or string. Unlike the unlucky fellow who complained that he lost the drive and all his data -- I wisely used a &quot;superglue&quot; and fixed it perfectly. A few weeks later the internal workings of the drive died and lost all my data. Sandisk is a pretty reliable company, but these tiny drives are a risky bet.

		<review-text>A fantastic little flash drive that doesn't feel out of place on your keychain (and is tough enough to resist the scratches your keys will mercilessly attempt to harm it with). Its speed is not the fastest on the market, but it's more than satisfactory for everyone but the most picky geeks.</review-text>

		<review-text>Okay i like this drive. It's slow-- but i just use it for backing some stuff up and moving files around. But I bought it for one reason only: to put on my keychain. I liked the small size for this purpose.

But i haven't had it very long and the key ring loop part of it broke. Really no way to fix it since it's just cheap plastic to begin with. And the plastic loop isn't that thick-- no wonder it broke.

So now it's just going to sit in a drawer I guess. The ring that connects to the key ring needs to be METAL, guys. Waste of money.</review-text>
