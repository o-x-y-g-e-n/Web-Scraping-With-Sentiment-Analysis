		<review-text>Ahhh here we go again, another Marvel film. And I know I'm probably going to annoy a lot of people but, this is my review and if people disagree good for them. Disappointing, great potential and I really, really wanted to like it but... I didn't. One of the most loved characters in the marvel universe butchered. In the comics T'Challa is portrayed as an intelligent and most importantly a serious character; however, if I were to meet him in real life I wouldn't have a clue what he'd be like, unlike almost any other marvel character such as Iron man, Captain America and even Ant Man etc. The protagonists in the film are undeveloped and this is most obvious when you compare them to the villains that are shown to have a political standing and given such a rich personality over everybody else, when the audience can relate and connect to the villains more so than the protagonists the audience can't drive and support for the good guys; like most other superhero films. Don't get me wrong the villains are shown as such but the lack of character from the protagonists leaves a sour taste is one's mouth, especially since black panther is such a great character in the marvel franchise. I loved the concept of the film, Africa is a great place to branch out into a new franchise of superhero's as well as villains; with a rich and interesting culture so rarely used in all superhero's films. I was really engrossed and absorbed with Michael B Jordan's character &quot;Warmonger&quot; and his political beliefs, compared to the protagonists his point of view was relatable as he had experienced the outside world and been formed by it just like us he was an outsider who wished to be a part of this futuristic and successful culture. However, the film lacked to drive home why his political stance was wrong, and how T'Challa's new approach will further benefit the world; I mean buying up properties in less developed parts of California is great but it was never really made clear to the audience (I mean me, and people less-smarter than me) what this was for. And you'd think for a film with an age rating of 12A, with such strong political elements would make it coherent what his solution was. Don't even get me started on the CGI, completely ridiculous and over used. Some elements were so unrealistic e.g. war rhinos who are able to target out their 'enemies', who are also meant to be their allies. if you've seen it think about it, weird right? One of the biggest things was the character T'Challa, who as I've mentioned is an amazing and really cool character, he is also rated to be sixth 'most intelligent' character in the marvel universe however on the big screen he was no-where near what he was meant to be, it was like he was a completely different character in the films; I don't want to sound like a comic book nerd, I love it when characters change in films but this is a completely new person with almost no similarities other than his name. I feel he didn't grow into a King instead he simply changed his political view which is a shame because why couldn't he do both. Worth a watch, but make your own opinion I mean I'm only a film student. Oh and who the hell cared when Forest Whitaker's character died because I certainly didn't, trying to make it like an important characters death, when actually we'd only seen him twice before.</review-text>

		<review-text>This movie is great of all the tribal people's of the world. Seeing hi tech combined with tribal royalty is interesting to say the least. Is this where we're headed? Forward to the past? Who can say..The plot was pretty stock standard. Plenty of stuff I'd seen before. Maybe because I'm white I didn't get the full movie effect. Listening to a black woman saying &quot;another white boy to save&quot; and getting a huge laugh seems a little strange when white people are soundly condemned for saying that to other races. I guess equality isn't for everyone.This movie will make loads of money, so I expect to see more tribalism in the near future from Hollywood.</review-text>

		<review-text>I really had high expectations going in, maybe too high, but at some point I thought the Black Panther was in the Fast and the Furious and then some typical heist movie. OK, I'm being harsh and I didn't hate it, just didn't like it, kinda blah. And all the talk about Marvels first black superhero, but as far as movies go lets not forget Blade. I have seen Blade a few times, and I think I like it better, a little bloody, but I liked Snipes in that role, he nailed it. You know what, maybe I'm just suddenly tired of these current Hollywood blockbusters.</review-text>

		<review-text>Well, i got to hand it to Marvel, though not always delivering great films, they manage to always stay on the right side of mediocre. I love the quality of their films, they more or less always look great, and in their films we constantly see great performances and witness memorable moments. But some of their films have stories and plots that can become somewhat predictable and washed down.This is unfortunately the case with Black Panther, it is a really gorgeous film, and it has some good performances, but nothing like we saw in for example Thor Ragnarok, where Cate Blanchett and Jeff Goldblum delivered really memorable performances and are great villains, or Kurt Russel in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2. This movie lacks a memorable villain like these.But it's not Jordan's fault, he plays the part really well, and might be the one that delivers the best performance in the entire film. But the character he plays simply isn't all that interesting or deep, and combined with a plot that is quite predictable, there simply isn't all that much excitement to go around. No nerve in the core of the story, almost everything you expect will happen, does indeed happen.But of course, the movie has it's moments, there are many scenes that are hands down great. And some action sequences are really well orchestrated, for example a long one shot action scene inside a casino, which was quite good. And there are plenty of short scenes that brings the giggles and puts a small break in the action scenes.The strongest part of the film is the visuals, it's quite obvious this movie cost a lot of money, though DC managed to spend 300.000.000$ on Justice League, and that movie looks horrible. Maybe Marvel just know how to spend their money more efficiently. But i wished they could have come up with a better story for Wakanda, though they did manage to establish the soul of T'Challa, we now know him, his moral standpoints and his capabilities, which is exactly why i recommend you to see this film.Though not by any means a perfect movie, far from it, it's still a worthy entry into the marvel universe, but don't expect any surprises, this is a straight forward film, but it's an important stepping stone before the majestic Infinity War enters theaters in about 2 months, which is not only the most expensive film ever made, but also the movie with most A list stars ever made. And it's nice to know all the character's that will face Thanos.TL;DR - Great visuals, weak story, predictable plot, not very exiting villain.6/10 - Fair</review-text>

		<review-text>If I were able to post a one or two word review, it would either be agenda or uncanny valley. Everything I feared this film would do, it did. Indeed in a couple of places it even referred to the (*spoilers*?) the slave trade! Seriously? In the 21st century you are going to refer at least twice in the same film to the slave trade - which BTW if you follow the film's premise would NOT have affected Wakanda as they were cut off from the rest of the world!The main character of the film is T'Chala - a character so depressingly dour and serious, he could be a candidate for depression. You have his younger sister - who is CLEARLY being geared up as effectively riri from the comics - she WILL be the replacement for Tony Stark! To best describe her, she is a light hearted Q from thee James Bond films - I liked her, she was fun, lively, bright, as a character a real find.Andy Serkis was excellent, but far too underused - Michael B Jordan's &quot;big bad&quot;? I understand the anger, I don't get his ultimate goal - makes NO sense. The female bodyguards were the nearest thing to Mary sues in the movie. Really - beating up men TWICE their size with the SAME military background?I MUST discuss the CGI. This is a MASSIVE problem.Sure Wakanda looks spectacular, but so did Asgard. It's the motion of the main characters that is the problem. It seems that whilst they can get stationary objects (buildings etc) virtually spot on now, the same can NOT be said for dynamic ones. If you have watched any of the trailers, you'll know what I mean when you see Black Panther do his somersault The dynamic CGI characters look crystal clear, whilst the real life objects have a faint blur to them. You can just see where the live action starts and the CGI ends. If the cars were CGI as well you wouldn't notice the difference so much, but it IS there, and because it seems 90% of this film is CGI, in the end it becomes very annoying.as for the claim that this is unlike any other Marvel film - I beg to differ - unless you refer to how insular the whole film is, as it is based almost entirely in Wakanda. Which could be acceptable, until you realise most of the action took place outside of wakanda - in the remaining 5-10% of the film!Winter Soldier was CONSIDERABLY better than this. Guardians was better and more fun! Avengers had greater scope.Ragnarok was funnier.I know EXACTLY who this film was geared for, and it was NOT for your typical Marvel comic book movie fan. it had good points, The tech wiz sis has major potential, Wakanda looked spectacular (if you ignore the poor water animations (the ripples in the water looked cut and paste, watch MOANA for how water can be animated!) The soundtrack bore no relation to the action (action scenes sounded the same as the quiet moments!). But the worst &quot;crime&quot; was the agenda it pushed. There is NO Excuse for this, as they PROVED they can have strong storyline in Winter soldier.So if you want a film with a dour dreary lead character, lots of uncanny valley moments, and LOTS AND LOTS OF POLITICAL GRANDSTANDING with no payoff, then this is the film for you!Just remember The Godfather / Goodfellas / Star Wars / Schindler's List all barely broke 90%, yet THIS is supposed to be 100%! If you don't think the ratings for this are agenda driven, I've got a bridge to sell you!I do NOT want a Black Panther 2 - I think the days of single super hero movies are done</review-text>

		<review-text>Visually, cool as heck. Effects were on point. Michael B Jordan as a villain was AMAZING. All else...skip. I wanted to like this movie and looked forward to it after BP's debut in Civil War. 
His character and performance, and the movie wasn't nearly as good as BP in Civil War. I was very disappointed last night. And I'm a huge fan of the MCU.</review-text>

		<review-text>With all the hype surrounding this movie (excellent trailers, Kendrick-curated soundtrack, all-African cast) I thought I was in for something special with Black Panther, as while they aren't remotely the highest quality movies, the Marvel cinematic universe movies are generally pretty entertaining. As it turns out I was wrong, Black Panther was extremely average, I have no idea what these critics/review bots are talking about when they say that it is the best Marvel movie and worthy of &quot;critical&quot; praise (as not just a super hero movie but as a movie in general.)Things that I liked:
Effort put into aesthetic authenticity of the African elements of the movie - within the Marvel universe the look and feel of the movie was unique and you can tell care was taken in this regard.Andy Serkis - My favorite character by far, was probably the only person who didnt seem like he was reading from a script sheet and got some genuine laughs out of me.Things that I didn't like:
The story was extremely predictable and to be honest I don't know if the most virtuous resolution was reached in the climax. Michael B Jordan's character had fairly reasonable intentions for wanting to kill the Black Panther and take his place in Wakanda as he had been abandoned, with seemingly no family, to live in the ghettos of Oakland. However, his whole plan to give advanced Wakandan weaponry to every African person in the world so they could kill and overthrow people in power who weren't African was extremely &quot;on-the-chin&quot; in terms of its narrative motivations within the current climate. It wasn't remotely clever or nuanced and really unbalanced his character, his motivations were understandable but his plan was moronic. Additionally, who didn't see Black Panther surviving his fall? Who didn't see the Gorilla tribe coming to the rescue at the end? The entire movie was so bland and predictable I wanted it to be over well before the end - I didn't even stay for the post credit scenes...The acting was very wooden - Not a lot to say here really, some really poor line delivery from the cast across the board except for Andy Serkis. No one was particularly charismatic, the main character for instance was extremely boring.The script was very robotic - This ties into the poor acting, but perhaps as a result of the script, some of the actors never really had a chance to bring their characters to life.The characters - I have already addressed the mess that was Michael B Jordan's character Warmonger(?). Basically throughout the entire movie you never really learn anything or see anything of the Black Panther's character, he basically moves from one place to another showing no emotion and just either smashes things or asks people questions. Apparently the character is supposed to be very intelligent, while it was probably a narrative choice, the Black Panther in this movie seemed like an emotionless Jarhead whose only really characteristic was that he get nervous around his girlfriend... The women in this movie had a bit of attitude and charisma and shouldn't be blanketed down with the Black Panther and Warmonger as bad characters, but they didnt really get a chance to shine and really only contributed a few one liners and a bit of fighting.The action - Shaky-cam rubbish, the action in the movie is terrible and not remotely on the level of the well-choreographed fighting in say Captain America Winter Soldier - please for the love of god show someone getting punched or kicked without having to cut the shot 5 times. There is an action sequence at the start which basically flagposted what the action was going to be like, it is shot at night and you basically cant see bloody anything...The CGI - Honestly, the CGI in Black Panther felt extrmely overused and was surprisingly quite bad. It really took me out of some scenes because the environments and effects looked average (not quite Justice League bad but not far off). It is obvious in scenes in Wakanda, for instance, where the plains/mountains are in the background but they are clearly filming in front of a green screen. Some of the effects just looked silly and got laughs out of me and my party. I personally though the Rhinos were stupid...The Soundtrack - After all the hype surrounding Kendrick Lamar curating a soundtrack for the movie, the tracks from that album barely feature at all. They faintly play from some cars and stuff here and there and a couple feature in some action scenes but I though we would be watching some decent action scenes with some bass heavy Kendrick blasting along to the fighting. Alas, no dice. The orchestral score is also quite average, coming in strong at weird moments and being quite out of place in certain places, there are a couple of moments where it seems like some sort of fairy, Harry Potter, Narnia music that just doesn't fit the scene.Overall I think this is probably one of the weaker Marvel movies, avoiding honest criticism because of the hype surrounding it. The basic components of the film are all poor-average, with the only real 5+/10 aspect being the aesthetics of Wakanda and its people. Like I said above, I wanted to leave well before it was over because I knew the action was probably not going to improve from nauseating shaky-cam and I knew how it was all going to play out.</review-text>

		<review-text>The cinematography and directing of this film was just OK, one would come to expect something better from a Marvel superhero film (as shown by the budget). The story was just ok, nothing exciting. Way too much spotlight on the Black Panther here, I feel the story would have been better told had there been another superhero. The acting also seemed either way too overboard for some of the characters, while others under-performed.Nevertheless, enjoyable, but certainly not even close to &quot;the best&quot; Marvel movie. It's only a 6/10 from me.</review-text>
		<review-title>Meh, highly overrated - not even close to &quot;the best&quot; Marvel movie</review-title>

		<review-text>Black Panther has got people throbbing, some saying it gave rise to Africa in the MCU. Critic's seem to all love it... reviews have been rave, even before the movie actually opened in Theaters. I found it funny, touching, strong as well as weak at some points... I do have to say that it has been over-hyped. It's not as good as Age of Ultron, and many of MCU releases. It didn't have a true villain we grew hatred for, Killmonger was just some angry kid to be honest. The women, do pick it up though, I'd hang a few but all of them did this movie good. Their roles infused well with the plot, and none of them disappointed me. To be honest with everyone else, I'd pretty much say that (as a black person) we loved Black Panther for it's cast and setting... Culturally - Black Panther is one of the greatest film's ever made, but Critically - It doesn't really deserve the universal acclaim. 7/10</review-text>

		<review-text>Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, I went into this film entirely objective (I didn't even watch the trailer). I am a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and was hoping this film would be good.The story is like any other superhero film story. The Wakanda aspect of the film is great. The technology used in the film is good. But there are a lot of clichés that kinda ruin the film.The acting is okay. Chadwick Boseman performs the best. Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, Danai Gurira, and Forest Whitaker perform below standard. Michael B. Jordan plays a generic and clichéd villain. He performs the worst.The action if very good, but the films pacing is terrible. The film starts off fast but comes to a halt halfway through. The runtime is very overlong as well.Pros: Chadwick Boseman's performance, good action, cool tech, and WakandaCons: Generic storyline, okay acting, Michael B. Jordan as a generic villain, terrible pacing, and an overlong runtime.Overall Rating: 4.5I really wanted this film to be good, but it felt like an overlong, clichéd, and dull film that was not needed in the MCU.</review-text>

		<review-text>Subpar to say the least. Political partisanship has now cemented its ugly head into almost every movie being delivered for mass consumption. Most moviegoers such as myself take in a flick to escape today's overt political nonsense and everybody's got an agenda world we live in........even if only for a couple hours. Forget about it. Not going to happen. For me there is so much effort to preach (as that's what it is) a particular political viewpoint that it totally interferes with story and character development. Because of this I found Black Panther almost unbearable and struggled to make it to the end. Besides that, technically the CGI was wayyyy off and character development severely compromised. Just awful. Possibly the most undeservingly overhyped movie of all time.</review-text>

		<review-text>I had high hopes for this movie after the stellar reviews started rolling in, but to be perfectly honest, this movie is EXTREMELY boring...One of the only action scenes in the movie is the air flip over the car you see in the trailer. The other is the awkwardly short &quot;climax&quot; at the end. Seriously, it's over so fast you won't believe it's really over. It felt like the director just wanted to call it a day and be done with this movie. Ultimately I feel really cheated after how amazing BP was in Civil War. Take a pass on this one, the critics are lying.</review-text>

		<review-text>97% Rotten Tomatoes. Really? Critics have gone mad or been paid a descent amount of money.It has no special story, and the plot is totally predictable. Colors and visuals are the only gorgeous parts of this film. I felt cheated after how amazingly Black Panther was shown in Civil War.It has been released in 3D but there are merely a few shots that felt good in 3D.Overall acting is okay; no actor leaves their mark on your mind. And as always, this Marvel movie too suffers with the villain deficiency syndrome.6 out of 10 from me, that's it.</review-text>
		<review-title>An average and typical Marvel film</review-title>
	</review>
	<review id="14">
		<review-text>In a nutshell... Waited 2 hours or so just to watch the cut scenes.To elaborate, this movie lacked a decent storyline, instead it was rather dull. I couldn't connect with any of the characters and as such cared little for their success or failure. Much of the hype I believe is due to the dominant African American cast. That's fine, when I watch a movie I don't care what colour people are, but in this case the hyper seems to have heavily depended on that fact and ignored more important aspects of a movie like storyline etc. The lead character was rather bland. Wait for this movie on netflix or something. I gave this movie 3 stars because Andy Serkis was funny</review-text>

		<review-text>A few of the actors could have been good, if they had a better script and direction.
Chadwick Boseman, Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o where especially bland. Found myself hoping they would be killed off by the end.Plot was the same as every other heroes quest plot. Except with less (zero) hero development. I've seen Roger Ramjet and Banana Man episodes with more hero development than the entire movie. Not even close to Marvel's lowest standards.Same for the villain. He was more vanilla than villain. Although he just barely had more character than the Hero.Fight scenes where dull, poorly motivated, poorly filmed and had little reason or logic. for the 40% where I could see what was going on I was mostly wondering why it was going on and why they weren't trying harder. I've seen better action filmed with a vibrating phone and posted to youtube with the wrong aspect ratio.CGI was horrible and glaringly obvious so much so they actually had special sound effects to warn you that the cgi was happening. Sound effects also had bad computer generated sound. Like 80's video games had a love child with 80's synth. The Black Panther suit was especially bad, Looked some kind of bulletproof hologram. Which could have been cool if thats what they where going for.Picture quality was really bad. I watched on a V-Max screen. It was very blurry. Not sure if this was just the cinema or if its the source material. Seemed to be worse in some places than others so likely the cinematography.
 Fight scenes where shaky and poorly framed, Futuristic city was out of scene, blurry and not very futuristic or believable. Looked like someone over polished a generic USA city and badly photo-shopped into India, not Africa. Except they still had bad (American) graffiti tags in the background. Was all shiny metal from a distance then grafiti concrete when up close... Overall was very confusing, not sure if futuristic slum was the angle or if was simply edited by a blind person who was so drunk they forgot half the cgi backgrounds.From a sci-fi point of view the futuristic tech was also really bland, clunky and left me wondering why.Politically The theme of hating everyone thats not descendant from Africa was simmering away the whole time. Found that pretty off-putting. Its not 1970 anymore. Re-visiting the politics of the Black Panther political party was pretty crass.Overall it left me with the impression that the marvel no longer wants to produce the content that made them famous but still want to cash in with out putting the effort in. Don't pay to see this. Might be worth watching on free to air tv if you're really bored and only get one station.</review-text>

		<review-text>Marvel fantasy origin film. Based in 'Wakanda', which is an African fantasy location. The source of the population vast wealth, and advanced technology is an ancient cosmic metal called 'nonsenseanium' The plot is poor, the acting is wooden, with no humour and hardly any action. We see how the 'Lion King Simba' rip-off becomes king and is challenged by the 'Scar' rip-off for his throne. The film has been over-hyped and not as good as the reviews lead you to believe, it appears that reviews are being cautious of giving honest criticism in fear of being called racist!I didn't much like Wonder Woman either, but this isn't even as good as that.
Overly long (134 minutes), very disappointing and boring.</review-text>

		<review-text>The most anticipated MARVEL film since 'The Avengers' (2012), does the hype surrounding 'Black Panther' pay off in terms of it being an exceptional film, or does it falter under the weight of expectations?1. There will be major spoilers scattered throughout my review so this is your last chance to stop reading if you have yet to see the film. The movie picks up a week after the events of 'Captain America: Civil War' as Prince T'Challa returns to his homeland of Wakanda and ascends to the throne as King. The plot on the surface is fine and delivers as expected, but the events that follow isn't anything new. Not saying that's a bad thing, but there was nothing that happened I wasn't surprised about. The more interesting subplot revolves around a past event in which King T'Chaka (John Kani) murders his younger brother N'Jabu (Sterling K. Brown) for trading Wakandan arms to various countries. It turns out N'Jabu had a son (Erik Killmonger) that grew up to seek revenge against the country that abandoned he and his father.2. As much class and style he possessed for his brief stint in 'Civil War', Chadwick Boseman is not interesting at all as T'Challa/Black Panther. Not saying he's a bad actor, but he plays the character with such drawl and lack of charisma. He does not &quot;own the role&quot; as they say, so it's hard for me to buy into it. Michael B. Jordan was by far the most interesting and sympathetic character by far. He brings much needed life into an already dull film. Jordan steals the show as Killmonger but unfortunately he has very little screen-time. After the sequence at the museum in the beginning, Jordan does not show up in the film until 40-45mins later. Killmonger is such a compelling character that by the time he finally pops up again, they rush through his story to where he feels under developed. I would wholeheartedly agree that he could have been the best villain of the MCU to date had the script-writers only incorporated him more into the story. 3. Andy Serkis was an interesting villain as Ulysses Klaue when he first appeared in 'Age of Ultron', but he's murdered by Killmonger halfway through so there obviously won't be any more development for him to say the least. Despite that, Serkis does make his presence known during the casino and chase sequence in South Korea. As far as action. there were only two sequences that I did enjoy, one being Black Panther chasing Klaue through the streets of Korea and Killmonger kicking the crap out of T'Challa to claim the throne as the new King. There honestly wasn't any other set-pieces I enjoyed or found mildly exciting. The final brawl between T'Challa and Killmonger on the subway track was awful. The CGI was weak and the overall fight was boring without any sheer tension or stakes.4. Apart from Angela Basset and Forest Whitaker, the rest of the supporting cast is either annoying or flat, and the same goes for the humor in the film. If it was up to me, the script would have gotten an overhaul or placed in the hands of actual writers to modify or (better yet) rewrite the whole damn thing. Despite the camera occasionally doing unnecessary close-ups on the fights, the cinematography on the African plains were amazing. The design on Wakanda and the sets blew me away, however, we don't spend a lot of time on the environments to say I felt captivated by it. Maybe 'Infinity War' might do justice for this character once more, but as for now, the Black Panther himself is a weak and undeserving (so-called) hero. Imagine Thor lost his home of Asgard, lost most of his people and even lost an eye all in his last movie, and I truly believe he'd make a better King than T'Challa and actually have the balls to rule Wakanda.'Black Panther' will undoubtedly sky-rocket at the box-office from all the undeserving false hype. Sure, kids will love it but there's no reason critics to honestly give such a mediocre film glowing reviews. Seeing it for what it, this movie is no better and probably lesser than some of the MCU film before it.</review-text>

		<review-text>This thing is being over-hyped to the max. The narrative is promising at the outset, but fails miserably as it deteriorates into the absurd, and then continues to drip like Chinese water torture from the poorly written screenplay. The acting was mostly amateurish with the exception of Forest Whitaker, who seemed out of his element, but the screenplay could very well be the culprit here. The entire production was a laughable exercise in nonsense, and the CGI was worse.</review-text>

		<review-text>First, this movie has a lot of pointless scenes that achieve nothing, the museum scene with pointless covert operation ending up in killing everyone anyway, that's so not Silent Assassin. The 007 Bond casino scene was just there to establish the most worthless character in movie history - Everett K. Ross. After the capture of Klaue (surprisingly surviving a horrible car crash), we get another pointless scene where Killmonger and his girlfriend re-capture Klaue just to kill him again for no reason. Killmonger never actually needed Klaue in the first place, so killing him was as pointless as freeing him out. Killmonger also kills his GF for no particular reason yet again. He could've easily get to Wakanda anyway since he has the royal tattoo (they also gave those to vampire servants in Blade). Then Killmonger and Black Panther participate in previously established variety of local Mak'Gora (election process I guess). Black Panther fails miserably and the new stronger king takes the throne, the end, right? No. They actually want you to root for the most useless and impotent king ever. Killmonger then says something stupid about colonization and oppression, and decides to use the Vibranium weapons (produced solely by a 16 y.o. girl mastermind) to conquer the world. So he's like pro-anti-colonization or something, you tell me. Yet he is betrayed by his people (Okoye literally says she will stay loyal to the king and in 5 minutes betrays the new king) and they all happily participate in a civil war slaughter until Killmonger gets killed. Also love how they intercepted their own ships with their own people, just murdering them. There was also some sort of brother betrayal, but it was so shallow and lacking motivation that it isn't really worth discussing. The brother (I think) wanted to have some more action and so he betrayed the king just to lower his weapons and suffer a life sentence afterwards. After slaughtering his own people, everything gets back to normal. And the king who solves all problems with violence decides to share his tech and knowledge to help the world. But not like the whole world, mostly African-american people in the US. I'm sure it's going to be pretty easy, since all technology in this world is done by one genius girl.Then we get the first post-credit scene when BP visits the UN assembly and says that he is ready to share the knowledge with all the nations. I'm pretty sure that we already have a lot of knowledge on slaughtering each other in wars and even civil wars, so his knowledge is not going to make a great difference.Summing it up, we get a weak impotent king to hold his throne. He never cared about anyone besides himself really, the fact that he suggests to heal Killmonger who killed Zuri just for lulz shows that he doesn't care. He never cares about his own people since he never hesitated on killing them personally. Just a little advice, if you wan't to have a good king character, ask Llane Wrynn how to rule.Killmonger was driven by revenge at first, then his motivation turned into some uncertain political position about oppression, but in the end it seems that he just loved his country (but not the people, it seems). The scene where BP suggests that Killmonger can be saved and healed completely destroys all the rivalry and the motivation of both. Anyway, Killmonger and Klaue were the best characters in the movie. The story was nonsense, they achieved nothing , BP leaned nothing and is still a worthless king and a bad leader. Was nice to see Serkis having a lot of fun in this movie, I love that guy and I'd love to see more of him (guess he's tired of playing CGI puppets...Gollum...Gollum).I also loved all the wishful thinking in this movie, which is mostly based on the comic I guess. Advanced native African people with space technology saving the world? Any educated person would suggest you checking South Africa after 1994. Supporting the immigrants in the US? Come on, guys...The good stuff: even though there were just 3 sets of Wakanda I still kinda loved it, the music choice was good, showing all that traditionalism, the nature. Killmonger's scene with his father was gold, I wish we had more dramatic scenes (it was well acted and well executed overall). The sister was kinda cool sometimes, being a more modern character and rejecting the old ways. Even though she's a little too much Mary Sue.Yet the main reason why I still decided to write this is the reviews. This has to stop. And I'm not talking solely about RT 97% which is just ridiculous. It's like people are afraid to judge something impartially cause of getting shamed for being racist or something. Also, this movie started with fair 7.1 on IMDB later to be loaded with &gt;30% of 10 ratings eventually ending up in 7.9 (as of now, I'm sure it will only go up). I'm not saying that IMDB has something to do with this, but this rating surely does not reflect the quality of the movie.Conclusion: don't trust ratings (nor RT or IMDB). If you like it - like it, if you don't - no need to be afraid to say that you didn't like it.You know you've seen a good movie when you exit the theater with something changed inside, an emotion, a thought - BP is not such a movie.</review-text>

		<review-text>I guess, because of the hype, I was expecting &quot;the best Marvel movie ever,&quot; or at least &quot;the best Marvel movie if the year.&quot;I pray to God and Stan Lee that this isn't the best Marvel Movie of 2018.The fact is, there are maybe 3 laughs in the entire film. Three moments where you smile. Three moments where you crack a grin and they all come exclusively from Letitia Wright.And it wasn't because there were jokes and they didn't land. It was really because the movie took itself far too seriously. Like Winter Soldier and Civil War it had a message to tell...but unlike the Captain American movies, it thought its message was so serious that it couldn't laugh even at itself.I think, honestly, it even forgot it was a Marvel movie. In fact at time I think that the director, crew, and cast all thought that they were making &quot;Roots&quot; meets the new &quot;A Birth of a Nation&quot;And Martin Freedman, yeah I think he was only there to prove that he could do a better American accent than his Sherlock counterpart. Maybe it was a bet, which part of the cast of Sherlock can hold an American accent throughout an entire film?And, honestly I am disappointed, because ALL three grins in the film went to Letitia Wright and Martin Freeman has some fairly decent comedic timing...they just didn't let it show. At least not for Freeman or ANYONE ELSE.Honestly, I'm surprised they even let Letitia Wright makes us smile or entertain us an any way.Honestly, it felt a lot like I was watching a college lecture...but a college lecture for a class that has a mandatory attendance policy and a professor that ONLY teaches from the book that he himself wrote...you get that kind of overly-serious pretentious feel to it.And...really, how often do people have to tell other people who they are in this movie? That really happened far too often and not in the &quot;Bond, James Bond&quot; way but in the &quot;If I tell you who I am it's going to give me extra power&quot; kind of way.And in the end you get two fight scenes by a waterfall that weren't very inspired and failed in comparison to other MCU fights. You get a car chase that was again...uninspired and fell flat but this time in the &quot;we've seen this before only done better&quot; kind of way. And a climatic battle that felt a little like the Gungan/Battle Droid battle in The Phantom Menace only with better CGI and an uninspired fight between the two powers rather than the Jedi dual.At least Winter Soldier and Civil War allowed us to laugh and relax a bit during the more serious MCU fair. At least they pulled out the stops when it came to action and, despite the message...tried to deliver something, anything.All this gave us was, well, a lecture and one where the action seemed, well, it seemed like the cast and crew felt they were obligated to give us that and thus did it with disdain.. It felt like all involved thought that entertainment would take away from the preaching.And really, have a message....just please entertain me. I work hard. I already went to school. What I want for the price of admission is to be entertained.If you can't do that, if you only let Letitia Wright make me smile and then only three times in a super hero movie that doesn't wow with action...then you've failed.In fact, you've failed so much that you aren't &quot;the first Black super-hero movie&quot; I'm taking that pilfered title and giving it back to Blade...because at least Blade was entertaining.</review-text>

		<review-text>My feeling after the movie - bored, something I won't watch again.Here is why I didnt like it (during the movie I felt like leaving, and thats a bad sign for someone who goes to the cinema every week): 1. All action scenes are blurred (you get a headache) and mostly dark (you can hardly see anything).2. While the movie is long in length the story feels short. Quite a few scenes are over stretched to add minutes but they dont add any content etc.3. Most actors act very bad. Ok how do you define bad. Well I guess their acting and emotions dont really match the situations 4. There are a few jokes, which feel very very misplaced and very low. I watched it on the big screen, so there many people around, but the laughs were pretty quiet.For me 5.5 out of 10 and I would never watch it again.</review-text>

		<review-text>My god are superheroes becoming one sided and formulaic. Ryan Coogler seems to be good at recycling the most typical structure of a marvel superhero movie because he really missed a huge opportunity to make a good fun action packed flick. What we got instead was a boring, typical, overly technological and overly political deus ex machina fest of an attempt to make a marvel movie.Boring characters plague this movie. The main character played by Boseman is really really boring and his &quot;son of a king&quot; arc can be found in any other similar character. Its really boring to see. Michael Jordan is the exaggerated villain who is bad cause being bad is bad and he is bad and revenge and badness. We really shouldn't judge a movie based on how much we agree with its politics. Any movie that should not be political that is lowers the quality of its own story by pandering to one particular mindset.The cgi was at times too much and too bad for its own good. Technology is used very cheaply to get characters we are supposed to love out of sticky, impossible to survive situations and its really pathetic.Typical, boring and overly political for a superhero movie

		<review-text>This is my second attempt to review this title. 
I was able to see a screening of this in Europe...waste of time. Predictable and laughable at points, it desperately tries to keep pace with other Marvel offerings but fails miserably. The storyline begins with an extremely promising origin for the characters but instead of capitalizing on this and building on it we move to forced action sequences that are poorly done (horrible CGI). That's where the attempt to keep pace with other Marvel and DC offerings becomes obvious...cliché phrases and over the top reaches to create new ones. Some borrowing from previous Marvel &quot;technology&quot; really tried to claim it to it's own, but was sadly obvious. Jordan did an outstanding job portraying Erik Killmonger and Whitaker was great, as always...the rest of the cast fell miles short of bringing these characters to life. It's okay to act with a chip on your shoulder because THAT'S what make hero characters pop...BUT you must act first. As the Marvel scene is beginning to become over saturated, this film at least allows us to take a break from an actual Marvel film.Not good enough to call &quot;cookie cutter&quot;...</review-text>
		<review-title>Very disappointing...</review-title>

		<review-text>I was pretty disappointed in this one, I am usually a sucker for superhero flick. 
The gadgets/tech ideas were great, but it was downhill from there. While there were a few good acting performances, most were not which was very distracting from the movie. It was really what ruined the movie for me. It also wasn't a great storyline, I can handle that it was pretty predictable, it is a superhero movie. However, it just seemed basic. Just when you thought it might gaining traction and pull you into it, it would just fall flat.Basically, I rate movies by a couple of things:
Does it pull me in - No
Did it entertain me - sort of, I looked at my watch a couple times... and 
 I didn't have anywhere to go, but generally it did.
Would I buy the movie when it comes out on Blu-ray and would I spend the extra for 4K - no, I might stream as part of my plan, but I would not spend extra money for it....I wish I would have just waited for that option.</review-text>
		<review-title>Probably the worst of the superhero movies thus far.</review-title>

		<review-text>After the excellent.....and hilarious.....Thor 3, I was rather looking forward to this. Positive reviews had also whetted the appetite. Perhaps it was the expectation that undermined the enjoyment?The genre is a little hard to quantify, but it reminded a lot of Wonder Woman. Except, instead of the WW2 setting, we had a kind of Bond-style thriller instead, complete with ridiculous gadgets and under-developed baddies.The film looks great (some dodgy CGI aside) - I liked the armour, weaponry and cultural aesthetics. I also felt a lot of the performances were quite compelling. Unfortunately, it is all rather dull. And doesn't feature anything we haven't seen before. What is most disappointing, is that it doesn't seem to tie into the Marvel continuity at all (apart from the unremarkable Everett Ross, who appeared from nowhere in Civil War and is a poor attempt to replace Agent Coulson). Like Wonder Woman, this is simply a &quot;Black Panther tale&quot; and you can take it or leave it when embarking on your next Marvel marathon.I also found the advanced technology to be completely over the top. Weapons and armour, I can understand. Miracle healing and Panther suits concealed within necklace teeth is VERY hard to swallow indeed. Vibranium was an indestructible Alien metal that could absorb sound. Fair enough. Great material for weapons and armour. But spaceships and miracle healing? Really? Couldn't we have toned it down just a little?I was bored. My friend was bored. After his wonderful debut in Civil War, this was a bit of a wasted opportunity.</review-text>

		<review-text>The plot was pretty snooze worthy if you ask me. Do yourself a favor and watch a good movie like The Cloverfield Paradox. I could not sit thru Black Panther again as it had very few actual action set pieces. The car chase was by far the best scene in the movie but sadly that was pretty much the climax of the film. The &quot;BIG&quot; action set piece was just boring with a cliché army set to fight itself because the kid with a chip on his shoulder his whole life makes his way back into the tribe. I also found the main Black Panther fight amongst the bad/good guy also boring. I could easily watch Iron Man again over this and Man of Steel. The story line is so dang simple but yet dragged out for a long time because the bad guy at first isn't really the bad, bad... guy. I found myself wishing I had watched the origin of the 1990 Black Panther instead which they hinted upon in the beginning as I think that would have been far more interesting but it wouldn't actual put BP into the new Avengers films. It just doesn't make much sense that they were fighting Ultron but BP was no where to be seen even though they seem to know everything that is going on... I also drove to the biggest IMAX in South Florida at the Museum of Science and the trailers had more bass than the movie itself. I felt like I wish Jurrasic World was playing instead. Oh well. I hope Infinity Wars makes up for this dreck.</review-text>

		<review-text>I went to see Black Panther along with my friends, and following the hype train we were excited to see it. However, following the showing we were all dissapointed by a mess of a movie with little plot and little thought which only served as a pit stop for infinity war.The critics have vastly overrated this movie due to its groundbreaking cast, but the movie itself is not at all groundbreaking. Littered with all the boring Marvel clichés I have come to know and hate, such as their inability to kill off any hero's to add gravitas to their story, or the one dimensional villain who only exists for one movie so you know they will kill him off before the next, Black panther is also plagued by new problems no one but me seemed to notice. For example, the CGI was awful in the action scenes: whenever someone was even prodded, they would go flying across the screen in the most outlandish fashion, and the plot was torn straight out of the Lion King, as well as having the biggest waste of Martin Freeman since those Vodafone adverts.Overall, I believe my dissapointment for this movie is fuelled by the marvel cinematic universe, as I feel sick of the movies they are pumping out like an industrial machine, as they all feel the same with little originality. I can only hope the bubble will burst sometime soon, and bring back true standalone movies which don't need a cinematic universe.</review-text>

		<review-text>Sadly I had big expectations for Black Panther as a HUGE fan of Black Lightning TV show, I was looking forward to this release only to be dismayed.At best it is a movie made with 90% green screen sequences but in reality it is a discombobulated mash of garbage that takes way too long to develop any story whatsoever and that storyline is as thin and weak as a nightclub whiskey, left stale overnight and re-poured.The hype is over-rated and the movie is ultimately disappointing.

		<review-text>Let me start out by telling you I am not a fan of Captain America and rate those movies maybe 3-5. I do like Iron Man and so desperately wanted to like Black Panther. I am a huge fan of Michael B. Jordan, he was phenomenal in Chronicle and Creed. The story and plot just don't sell me, I mean seriously a secret technological civilization hidden for centuries? My question is where was this advanced civilization when Loki was taking over and when Ultron was set to destroy the earth? No logic! 
The special effects where good, but I feel that's all it had going for it and I would have liked to see Michael B. Jordan beat Black Panther, I would prefer him King over T'Challa.The only good Marvel movies are Thor, Iron Man, Dr Strange and Avengers, the rest...Meh! Black Panther, Ant Man and Captain America have too similar plots in context and rely too much on CGI. So Does iron Man but RDJ has the persona to make most people like it. Sorry I would give Black Panther a 9 for special effects but with a plot that's been done over and over again, just didn't set well with me. Maybe it would have been better if the media would not have hyped it up.</review-text>

I have to say that I really like scenery in this movie unfortunately the story line, characters and actors all failed to deliver. I almost fell asleep, something that hasn't happened to me since watching The Postman as a child. Don't expect the typical Marvel adaptation, this movie takes itself very seriously and that's one of its biggest drawbacks, it's simply not fun or entertaining, the plot is very predictable, the acting feels forced and character development is lacking. I think my low rating has to do with my initial expectations, it was nothing like I imagined. The only pros other than the cool scenery is Chadwick Boseman, he's just a great actor that did his best with what was provided to him.</review-text>

		<review-text>This movie was a bunch of tribes fighting over alien tech. The group that has and decides who to share it with and benefit from it against the groups that do not and either work with/for them or are trying to steal it away. The main villians are insane or dumber than a street thug. The leaders are incompetant and confused while the other tribes (gangs) are laughable. I left this movie thinking it was written for grade 2 students who still like power rangers and stuff like that. It was meant for those out there who suffer from severe arrested development, which unfortunately today seems to be a very large portion of the planet so I am sure it will do quite well with the large target audience availble to it. This movie was not good, it was not terrible but it is definitely not as good as the hype and is really only getting this sort of attention becuase of the real world politics and racially charged crap that has been flung around about it.</review-text>

		<review-text>&quot;Black Panther&quot; is the first Big Budget and Ensemble Cast Black Superhero/Comic Movie made in history. Despite all that was put into the production of this film, all audiences get is yet another Typical, Very Generic, and Over the top Cliched Superhero/Comic movie that has been shown and told hundreds of times before.Despite the movie's extreme lack of originality, there is some entertainment to enjoy here. The World of the movie is not only good looking and interesting but very Sophisticated, the most ever seen in the Superhero film genre. There is a lot of &quot;Eye-Candy&quot; to see throughout the movie but it cannot cover up the lack of storytelling and &quot;Amateurish&quot; acting from a good cast of acting talent. From Costume design, to certain set pieces, make-up, etc. are well done, but are often ruined and spoiled due to Poor and Weak Visual effects work. If your expecting a Great Visual Effect Superhero Movie Spectacle prepare to be disappointed here. The CGI is very noticeable and often times characters and objects look like Cartoons. In addition, the choreography in the action and fight scenes are slow and obvious, looking like actors in Theater Rehearsals waiting for their cues. Furthermore, The performances are good, Chadwick Boseman and Letitia Wright stand out the most overall, including the acting chemistry between the two of them. The weakest and worst of the bunch are Micheal B. Jordan and Martin Freeman as both their characters were not only generic, but extremely Dull. Martin Freeman's &quot;Everett K. Ross&quot; was meaningless, had no real purpose to be involved in the narrative at all, and add Michael B. Jordan's &quot;Killmonger&quot; to the List of Forgettable Villains, which has become a consistent trend in Marvel Studio movies over the recent years. Others such as Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis's characters perform well with what they were working with, but both have limited screen time to help really benefit the film's narrative at all. Finally, &quot;Black Panther&quot; is a Comic/Superhero movie that stays true to it's guns from beginning to end. It doesn't deviate from it's tone and story arc unlock most Marvel Studios movies always do. On a personal note, it's good to finally get another Marvel Studios movie that focuses on it's Title Character instead of a Superhero movie that follows multiple characters and story arcs at the same time that are pointless with no meaning to the Main Title's Protagonist. Overall, &quot;Black Panther&quot; may be another forgettable Superhero Movie, but it is a decent addition to the Comic Book Superhero Genre, including to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</review-text>

		<review-text>I took my nephew to see this today, expecting a wonderful memorable film. Instead, it was dull and full of cliches - a stale rehash. I feel that the critics are afraid to tell the truth about this film because it certainly does not deserve a 98% rating on RT. It's sad that our society cannot be honest about ratings due to fear of ostracization. Usually Marvel heroes use humor to charm the audience, but the Black Panther uses old, worn out cliched formulas. Although it's not a terrible film ,it is certainly not deserving of anything over 50%. There were too many negative racial overtones, and I believe Marvel/Disney need to keep their political ideologies out of the moves. THe visuals were good, but the story line got lost.</review-text>

		<review-text>Let me get right to the point. Among the Marvel movies, Black Panther is one of the least successful productions. It's not so much that it lacks any of the major elements of other Marvel films. It has a superhero who kind of has special powers, it has special effects, and it has somewhat innovative fight scenes. No, the problem is in the acting and I'll put the blame for this on the supporting female characters. Their acting is of B-movie quality. It is wooden and stilted causing a lack of any believable emotional connection to other characters in the film. In an effort to make the female characters into powerful male-like warriors, they have sacrificed their humanity,Most of the male acting is only slightly better. Chadwick Boseman is okay. Michael B. Jordan is a pretty good villain, and Daniel Kaluuya is believable and sincere. But when Sterling K. Brown appears in a cameo, we realize what real good acting consists of and we are suddenly forced to realize what the film is missing. The plot is predictable, like most Marvel films. It seems to lack some underlying ideal, although it makes an attempt to do this in the conversation we see with Mr. Panther and his father, played very well by John Kani. In the conversation, his father advises him to surround himself with good people, which may serve as an indirect criticism of the corruption that so often appears in African governments. We also have the issue raised by Erik Killmonger (Jordan) who asserts that Wakanda should give its precious super- mineral, vibranium (give me a break), to oppressed black people so that they can fight their oppressors. Much is made in the pre-release hype about the technologically-advanced, mythical African nation, Wakanda. To me, it looked like Oz's Emerald City without the emerald. There is also a lot of talk on how this film unites black people around the world. Maybe it does. It just seems to me there are so many other films that could do a better job at this and keep us entertained at the same time. In short, there is not much in this film that will keep the average viewer involved. There are some mildly interesting fight scenes and the obligatory car chase has some novel elements, but I would not recommend the film as a whole. Nonetheless, the momentum the film has received from the pre-release media storm will no doubt end up with it making some good box office returns: A triumph of marketing over quality.</review-text>

		<review-text>What an awful film. It was like some awful mashup of Roots, Lion King, Narnia and Coming to America. And of course if I am negative? Let me guess, I'm a racist. Please. I am happy to watch any film with a strong message and the message this film tried to tell is a hugely important one. But this film failed in every department. I didn't laugh once. I remember smiling at one point but that was it. Charaters were horribly wooden - Case in Point - Forest Whittaker. The CGI was clumsy and not believable. The car chase was too cartoon-like with no &quot;real&quot; feel. 
ANd armour plated rhinos? - Really? Licking the face of their &quot;friend&quot; - Jurassic Park 1. This is the worst film I have seen since Happy Feet 1. In that turkey we were told that penguins are important to save because they can dance (to non-existent music)
This is as bad. I would have walked out but I was so curious if it could get any worse I stayed. It could - and it did. Awful</review-text>

		<review-text>Much as Wonder Woman is unlikely to significantly improve gender equality, I also doubt Black Panther will have a long-term impact on racial equality. Maybe each showing for Black Panther could be pre-empted by a showing of I am Not Your Negro, although that documentary is miserably lacking in the explosions and stabbings which fill Black Panther.There are a lot of fights in Black Panther, a lot of them where light is lacking, making the whirlwind attacks difficult to parse, confusing to discern, and baffling to ingest. There are calls to action coupled with critiques of isolationism, a couple of astral projections, and several Black Panthers. With the Q-like Shuri helping improve tech gadgetry, a better title might have been Vibraniumfinger.Black Panther lacks the fun of other Marvel fare like Deadpool or Spider-Man: Homecoming, maybe intentionally so, with awkward jokes peppered in a just the wrong moments, trying to bring light-heartedness into dire situations and uncomfortable realities. If the world outside is one of unjustly oppressed people, the world inside is only as just as the strongest, most enlightened, and physically fittest autocrat.We learn that bad power leads to oppression, and good power leads to good oppression, but only if used properly and respectfully. Blind loyalty to a power structure keeps the system intact, and there are definitely things They do not want Us to know.</review-text>

		<review-text>All I can say is don't bother or wait for rental or streaming if you insist on seeing this turd as it is yet another in the long line of films in Disney's crusade to reduce every beloved fictional character to an agenda-driven caricature. In case you didn't know it: Disney did not create the Black Panther, nope, they bought him (comparison to historical evils is intentional) and milked him for all he's worth. To make matters worse, if you are old enough to remember, the character was created in precisely the opposite spirit of this trite, overly-politicized nonsense. There are some decent performances, but otherwise this film is devoid of any merit whatsoever, even within the context of the MCU. Save your money and your time or get some of the old comics, they have fun and heart, two things Disney abandoned long ago in their endless quest for the maximum profit possible.</review-text>

		<review-text>Critics are considering it as one of the best MCU movie till date. After watching the movie I am totally baffled by such exaggerated reviews. Puttibg this movie in same pedestal as winter soldier, Iron man, Avengers or Civil War is highly inappropriate.
The movie starts strongly with history of Wakanda and a captivating scene set in past. The world building of Wakanda is impressive in the beginning and it immediately generate interest in this fictional nation. Sad part is all your expectations turn to dissapointment when this movie becomes a generic affair with a very lazy story plot and predictable climax. Character of Shuri as Tachalla's brilliant sister is highlight of the film and rest of the cast is equally good. Movie has veen able to give depth to most of the characters and that is the strongest suits of the film. It is a shame that such characters are reduced to action figures rather than progressing the plot of the film. Film mention various issues faced by colored people which is the key motivation of villain Killmonger. When you expect a well thought off resolution of the central conflict of the film, all you get is punches, kicks and a lazy climax fight sequence. The most interesting premise or conflict raised in a MCU movie after winter soldier (privacy vs security) is resolved with 1 guy in suit fighting with another guy in suit in a cheap CGI battle (remember other numerous other MCU battles). I have no clue how can critics consider it an extremely good movie which will change landscape of superhero movies, it is strictly average at best. Good characters and an interesting premise are wasted and they can only take a movie this far with such a predictable script.</review-text>

		<review-text>For me, the first Iron Man was the only authentic movie from marvel. But seeing all the reviews, I thought Black Panther was promising. Yet it proved to be way worse than any online review. The cast and some action scenes were the only part making it a &quot;movie&quot;. There were many promising drama elements on race politics, father-son relation but none were presented in an original way. The movie was annoyingly predictive as if a parody of itself. Maybe Marvel has already consumed itself. It is a huge chance gone wasted. Probably I will not spend money on another Marvel movie ever again.</review-text>

		<review-text>Well, it doesn't feel like an MCU movie. It takes itself way too seriously to be part of the MCU. The since of humor that made Guardians of the Galaxy, Spiderman, Thor and most of the other Marvel movies so fun to watch over the years has been stripped away.And so has the spy movie fun with the Captain America movies, but then, those didn't take themselves nearly as seriously either, even when they had a message to convey. The Black Widow could still kind of make fun of the lead. I got the sense that there was absolutely no way the Black Panther could be the butt of a joke. Somehow he was beyond even that.And people kept saying that this was the best Marvel movie...why? Honestly I have no idea. The action wasn't even really there to support that. Two fights in a river by a waterfall. A kind of climatic battle that served to be the best part in a movie that took itself all too seriously. A car chase. All were totally uninspired. There wasn't much new there. The car chase we had seen before. The climatic battle at the end was just...meh. And the two fights by the waterfall didn't really deliver.And all while being mostly void of humor. We had Letitia Wright delivering the only grin worthy lines. This isn't overstating things either. She was very literally the only smiles in the entire movie. We had Martin Freeman there to...I guess...prove that he can do a better American accent than his Sherlock counterpart.And then we had a movie that was trying to deliver a message that it wasn't entirely sure how to deliver or even sure what the message was...but whatever it was, it was strong enough where the audience wasn't allowed to laugh.I don't care about the PC crap, comic books have always had a message, a moral, at least the mainstream ones. But I still wanted to be entertained.</review-text>

		<review-text>97% on RT, that will really get me and everyone else I know into the theaters to watch this film. Please give me my money back. Lame action scenes, lame story, lame characters and a lame superhero, indicative of so many comic book characters being made into films these days. The Hollywood film industry has lost it's artistic flare. In the past, the critics use to have our backs; those days are long gone.</review-text>
		<review-title>Over hyped and over rated movie</review-title>
	</review>
	<review id="62">
		<review-text>Oh yes, this review has spoilers. 1. Lupita Nyongo and Winston Duke do an amazing job in the movie; Chadwick Boseman is way too boring and terrible of an actor to be a leader. Michael B. Jordan completely fails as an actor here. He needs a Razzie for this performance. The rest of the cast are simply contrived or phoning it in for an easy paycheck. Andy Serkis did seem to enjoy his role. It felt like a waste when he was killed off.
2. Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger is the worst villain ever in the Marvel universe. Jordan approaches the character, who is supposed to be a genius, like an NFL defensive end that is on steroids, which makes it very hard to take him seriously. He was smart enough to graduate from the Naval College at 19 and go to MIT for grad school but opts to become a SEAL who kills hundreds of people? Right. Worse yet, Killmonger also appears the be the only character in the history of Wakanda that has any sort of common sense. Aren't you not supposed to sympathize with the bad guy?
3. The whole premise of the country of Wakanda is an insult to Africans and black people in general. Instead of basing Wakanda on your average African country, it is portrayed as being like a futuristic Shanghai with tech that is decades, if not centuries advanced. How in the world has no one left Wakanda and told the world about what is there? How has it been kept a secret? Why haven't they conquered the world? Killmonger is the only leader of Wakanda that has figured out what the country is capable of! Once again, that takes you completely out of the movie. How can a society be so advanced but yet not understand how powerful it is?
4. Wakanda is supposed to be the most advanced nation of Earth but everyone still dresses and acts like primitive tribal people and even determine their leadership through individual combat. Despite being advanced, T'Challa's bodyguards use spears and call guns primitive. Seriously?
5. M'baku, the leader of the Jabari tribe, wants to be the Black Panther very badly and hates every other tribe, but when presented with the chance to ingest the flower that will give him the Black Panther's strength and kill off T'Challa, opts to help him recover instead and take back his throne. Predictably of course, he claims to not want to help T'Challa at first, only to show up during the battle. Surprise! Not really.
6. On the topic of predictability, as soon as you see Daniel Kaluuya's character, you know he's going to be the friend that stabs T'Challa in the back.
7. They tried too hard to push Shuri as a lovable Q like character, but she was never convincing at all. If anything, she was beyond annoying.
8. Black Panther's father, as Black Panther, commits an unsolved black on black murder in a project in Oakland in 1992. I am not making this up.
9. T'Challa comes to Oakland in the present day, shows some kids his futuristic jet, who then gawk and start discussing how they will steal it, strip it down and sell the parts. Once again, not making this up. Wasn't this supposed to be a positive film for black people that didn't reinforce negative stereotypes of them?10, 20 years ago, movies like this would have been nominated for a Razzie. Now, they are getting near perfect scores on Rotten Tomatoes and under consideration for Oscars. I'm just not buying it. This was one of the worst movies I'd ever seen. I could go into detail but I just can't remember everything. You've been warned.</review-text>

		<review-text>So over hyped and drenched in slo-mo CG it is hard to remember this is a MCU COMIC! The acting was... well... marginal at best...unless you are looking for attitude at every turn. Marvel needs to really strip out the socio-political tripe from their movies. This isn't the first but this one dripped in it REALLY ruining the MCU story line.
Speaking of the MCU connection... THERE WAS NONE .
This sits as an island of CG phantasm to someone's ego and is NOT the Black Panther I knew well in Lee's fantasy realm of comic stories.
No background ever given to support the absurdist fantasyland, and no REAL story beyond...&quot;We need help - Call this guy&quot; . THAT was the weakest part... No sustainable story line so it was hard for the characters to ever emotionally develop or connection.... just rubber suit flexing for 2 hours.
Expected so much more. That Guardians of the Galaxy is still rated King of all the MCU productions... not just in attendance and financial success.... but in pure Lee Production and being true to the Legendary MCU characters.
TRY AGAIN please Stan. You can do so much better. And viewers can certainly find a better way to spend two painful hours than cringing at these badly delivered lines.

		<review-text>Such great hype,imagery and effects, loved the trailers. Pity that every action scene is in the trailer, and the rest is just lame story lines, about the prince from somewanda (Wakanda). I kept waiting for Eddie Murphy to walk out and crack jokes. It has the prince and queen and staged like Eddies film and same &quot;set like&quot; feel for the royal ascension. The constant drums in the soundtrack felt like The Lion King. 
I would have walked out, but I paid Gold Class and wanted to finish my snacks. 
Probably some great social underlying story, but when the bad guy &quot;wanted to see the sunset&quot;, I struggled not to laugh out loud.

		<review-text>This film is not helped by the impending Avengers: Infinity War. It is certainly not helped by running that trailer before the film and instantly removing any jeopardy by showing us which major characters live to appear again in the future movie!More importantly though, how do Michael Bay style fight scenes still exist in a world where John Wick choreography is available and Marvel money is on the table? Honestly, I hated the last 20 minutes so much I felt like I was watching a Transformers spin-off. Not just the war-rhinos, which were utterly, shockingly bad, but the entirety of all three of the final sequences were poor CGI, poorly shot, poorly choreographed and added absolutely nothing. Also this is the first Marvel movie where I simply didn't care about any of the characters. No-one was relatable. The closest I could get was to Killmonger, who at least had reasons for his overall behaviour and a character arc that goes somewhere. But if I have to associate with a murderous villain who kills his own friends for no reason that isn't endearing me to the film.</review-text>

I mean inventions popping up in Iron Man is understood, that is what Tony Stark is! An Inventor and a technology genius. However Black Panther has over killed it.Looks bad for Marvel to do something like this and make a total joke of Iron Man.The vision here is colluded. The story of T'Challa and Wakanda were important, not the &quot;candifying&quot; of inventions just like that. Another misadventure like this by MCU and they will taste failure I bet. Simply put, please stick to the authenticity and priorities in a comic book story line, over inflated deviations will cost you dearly.</review-text>

		<review-text>I am going to do my review a little bit different from how everyone else is doing it. I read through the reviews on this site about black panther and I have to say how sad it is that majority of you here haven't even watched the movie but are bashing it because you have some kind of prejudice about it.I will give valid reasons as to why I believe majority of the people here haven't watched this movie and are reviewing with intentions to sabotage.First of all, some of the people are saying the acting is bad or just ok and maybe just picking one person as the only highlighted actor who shines. Well this is absolutely false because this is the first MCEU movie that put the supporting characters right there with the lead actor. Martin Freeman, Duke Winston and W'Kabi are minor supporting casts but had more in moving the movie and plot ahead than any other minor characters in other MCEU movies. Martin Freeman had such great comedic timing and was badass as Agent Ross that he stole the scene whenever he appeared. Duke Winston is the reason why I am officially #TeamM'Baku even though I knew nothing about him or the Jibari (?) Tribe. W'Kabi shows versatility in the inner conflicts he has about his friendship to T'challa and his agenda.So imagine these minor characters having had such an impact in the movie then what about the main supporting acts such as Danai Gurira (?), Lupita Nyongo, Andy Serkis, Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Letitia Wright and Michael B Jordan? They were on another level from the aforementioned minor supporting acts and brought the heat.People calling Michael B Jordan a generic villain is like putting Michael Jackson on the same level as Justin Beiber. This is a villain that you wanted to win even though you knew his intentions would bring about chaos and anarchy. I have never seen a villain this full of hate and contempt but so charismatic at the same time. Most people compare him to Loki but I never clapped for Loki thats for sure. Most people talked about generic storyline but thats because they haven't seen the movie and are using past movies as reference. This movie isn't just about Black Panther but several others who all have arcs that must then come together like butt cheeks and be the shh. It was connected nicely and brought to a conclusion that didn't leave anything untold. Most people talked about the action being great because they thought they could use that to throw people off but the action wasn't as great as it could have been since some were too dark and others were shot too fast making the fight scenes kind of redundant.CGI issues too but those are just nitpicks because overall a great story is told and that is what is most important about making a movie.So all you people who haven't seen it and are writing fake reviews, go and watch it and THEN write a proper review.I give it a 9.4 out of 10I still hold Captain America: Winter Soldier as the best Marvel movie which sits at 9.5 out of 10.</review-text>

		<review-text>Like most movies, there are plenty of things to like about Black Panther, and plenty of things to dislike.LIKE:
1. It's Marvel. Even a middling MCU venture is still worth the price of admission.
2. It looks sensational. Everything just looked really, really cool. The city, the technology, the natural splendor, the costumes, etc. Very, very cool.
3. It's something different. Basing a movie and a superhero franchise in Africa is refreshingly different.
4. Little sister. The &quot;Q&quot; of Black Panther. Tough not to love her.
5. Angela Basset is as lovely as ever. Lead actor was terrific.
6. Pretty good plot twist.DISLIKE:
1. I fear this whole superhero genre is starting to reach the end of its tether. All of the story elements are just starting to feel a little stale.
2. Although very good, Black Panther is nowhere near as good as X-Men, Avengers, Ragnarok, Spider-Man, and almost any other MCU production.
3. It seemed like it was pretty difficult to break away from the tentacles of The Lion King. It was really tough not to be thinking about it though the movie.
4. The racial elements seemed a little heavy-handed and clumsy.
5. I think I'm getting Forrest Whitaker fatigue.
6. These superhero flicks really need to reevaluate what a climactic fight scene is supposed to be. I was getting bored out of my mind during the last twenty minutes.
7. The opening weekend hype was pretty ridiculous.Overall though, another trophy on Marvel's overflowing, jam-packed shelf. Go see it.</review-text>

		<review-text>Ok, I get that they want to introduce the character and give it an arc. But that didn't happen for Hulk (In an &quot;Avengers&quot; scheme, although it should have) and it sure as hell wasn't necessary for this one.
The movie was WAY too long, boring and just redundant. Everything past the 30 minute mark was just a waste of time and money.
They grossly overplayed the &quot;African&quot; aspect and it just felt like it was shoved in your face in every single chance they got. Hell, even Ross (Martin Freeman's character) felt to be forced to recognize and be a part of the &quot;tribe&quot;.
As a huge Marvel fan, I was incredibly excited to see this, see the universe expand. But I was hugely disappointed. 
The only thing I can commend in this movie are the visual effects and the music. Loved them.</review-text>

		<review-text>GADGET 1 : Half of Okeye's body appearing on T'Challa hand. She wasn't even a hologram.GADGET 2: Shoe pads turn into sneakers? Come on.Gadgets are senseless, maybe worse than some of James Bonds gadgets. Movie doesn't explain the shoe pads and Okeye appearing TChalla-Wkabi's palms. I'm guessing alien technology. But even if it is alien technology, its really bad. I can't see those ideas being used in others sci-fi movies.VISUAL EFFECTS: After watching SPIDER-MAN VS VULTURE and THOR VS SURTUR I was expecting to see something amazing. Instead I saw average fight scenes. I saw full action sequence of T'Challa flip in the air in slow motion during bridge scene. It looked as cheesy as it did in the trailer. The Rhinos and the Black Panther purple glowing suit could have been better. This one had much more drama than action. It also got really slow in some parts. My favorite VFX scenes are the ones with Andy Serkis's (Claw).POLITICAL INTENTIONS: The movie focuses on politics, governing and leadership. I researched and I haven't seen a Black Panther comic book series description on the Wakanda walls. But the speech was really good at the end. DISNEY MARVEL MOVIES ARE GENERIC and sometimes too silly because they are RUSHED. Black Panther would have been the best MCU movie if Disney spent more time on it. Black Panther deserved better. SHOULD YOU WATCH: If you and your kids are not open minded people, sensitive when it comes to political subjects that are very relative to whats going on in our country in films, I would pass on this one in my opinion. MY REAL SCORE is 5/10. I mixed on Black Panther. Its enjoyable to watch, its not too boring and not exciting either. The message and the acting were the best parts of the movie for me. I took out 5 points because the movie seemed rushed. Lazy technology writing and lazy visual effects was the killer. </review-text>

		<review-text>I am a huge Marvel fan and have seen all of their movies within the first week they came out. I have to say this is probably one for the bottom 2 or 3 positions. The Good: The costume design and the premise for the settings is great, the characters are generic yet fun to watch, the tech and visual effects are superbThe Bad: The plot is riddled with plot holes, the plot itself is so generic especially the final accumulation of the film, I understand the need for social messages but the films forces them on you without really making you want to support the message being givenAll in all I would say watch it without expecting too much.</review-text>

		<review-text>Don't waste your money if you're expecting anything more than a mediocre superhero movie. I don't understand how this is getting such high praise from critics when it simply is just a mediocre superhero movie. I would go as far to say that it is on the lower end of the spectrum from films from the MCU. This movie simply isn't good, but it isn't horrible either. It certainly has its somewhat redeeming qualities: The cinematography is masterful at times combined with the amazing CGI and set pieces make it a pleasure to look at. As well as the amazing acting/actors. But honestly I expected more from Ryan Coogler as he had in the past directed some great movies such as Creed. But even all of these amazing qualities weren't enough to make the film good. The storyline was lackluster with boring and predictable character archs which go nowhere giving the feeling of no development really being made by the end of the movie. Although some action scenes were good due to the quality CGI, the fight scenes were extremely mediocre and uninspired and became quite repetative at times. Though the weapons and gadgets used were quite col which made the fights a little more fun, but more of these should have been used to make these otherwise boring fight scenes more interesting so they don't seem to drag on as much.
Overall the movie was just meh. Nothing spectacular and nothing dreadful. Just a so-so, second rate. run of the mill superhero movie.</review-text>

Michael B Jordan was a great villain, unfortunately Marvel ruined it by turning this tough contract killer into a clown. The jokes were few and far between and as out of place as a DC film. The action was bathe in bad CGI reminiscent of The Matrix Reloaded. A great story was ruined with an unnecessary love story. I don't know why critics are turning their back on Blade and Spawn. these movies were the first black Superhero films. Spawn was also flawed, but even with it's shortcomings, it's a far better movie than this. Blade on the other-hand was extremely well done and Black Panther doesn't come close to capturing the action, energy or excitement of Blade. I really hated this film and Coogler had been on a streak. Who knows, Black Panther didn't impress me in Civil War either. He's strong in the comic books, but I honestly don't care for Chadwick Boseman. 42, Get on Up, Draft Day, all really bad films. This guy appear to be the black Shia Lebeouf. I guess Hollywood is planning to shove him down our throat like they are doing with Josh Gad. We are limited with strong black talent in Hollywood, that doesn't mean we should be using just anyone for pivotal role. My 5 stars for this film are generous.</review-text>

		<review-text>I am as big of a Marvel fan as it gets and it pains me to admit that movie is very below average in every way that matters for a film. It places a warped political commentary first and foremost and delivers intelligent entertainment a far second. In this already divisive era, we deserve better than this from Marvel. Those praising the film are doing so with a blatant agenda...not because it is good cinema!</review-text>

		<review-text>I am a big time marvel movie fan. I watched every single marvel movie that is out at least more than once. There are my favorite ones and some that i don't like... and i hate DC movies period. This black panther has to be the worst marvel movie ever... it was boring boring and boring. Probably because i had such high expectation from Marvel even before walking into the theatre. I definitely thought this movie was not entertaining at all...</review-text>

		<review-text>I've just been to you see this film and wanted to walk out half way through it really started to get annoying the script is terrible the affects are sub par and except for Michael B Jordan, Andy Sirkis and Michonne from the walking dead the acting is pretty terrible the only reason I gave it 5 stars was that the kids really enjoyed it.</review-text>

		<review-text>No doubt that the visuals were stunning and the portrayal of Wakanda was amazing. But as far as a MCU movie goes, Black Panther looked like an another conventional superhero movie which provide very less to entertain the audience or even connect with the character. As a Marvel fan, my expectations were really high for this movie, especially when we are going towards The Infinity War. But all and all 'Black Panther' disappoint me and i think it's better to not watch it on a big screen.</review-text>

		<review-text>Summary of the movie :
When the side character that you see for 3 minutes in the movie is more interesting than the main characters then you know this movie is bad. Its terrible, save yourself, dont go. Its nothing like a Marvel movie we know. NOT funny, NOT interesting, WEAK plot, TERRIBLE acting, BORING everything. Skip this one or Marvel will think we want more of this crap.Note from me : Normally I do not write reviews unless I feel cheated. I am quite a fan of Marvel movies and always go to see but on that one I was thinking about leaving in the middle and asking for my money back. Worst part is that it will be probably a success because most of people just go without reading any reviews because its a Marvel movie, just like me.</review-text>
		<review-title>Dont go so Marvel wont produce trash like this again.</review-title>

		<review-text>I was looking forward to Black Panther last year when it was announced, but as the release came closer, it became clear that the marketing team was working overtime. In fact, it became suspiciously clear that the movie may be compensating for something.And also in fact, I admit being turned off because every web page I visited, every trailer I wanted to see, everywhere I turned, Black Panther's ads were in my face worse than a mobile service provider or insurance ad. At least those didn't take over what I am trying to read.So, seriously, I knew there was going to be political and social messages, I can't think of any Marvel or DC superhero movie that doesn't have one. I accept that the atrocities that have happened and happen today in Africa can be powerfully addressed in a mainstream movie, indeed I was looking forward to it.What I think is a shame is how that chance was buried beneath magical technology. I know, I know. The comic book version made it work. On big screen, the costume-change was more absurd than when Wonder Woman spun around in a blast of light. And I know so many of the others in the Marvel universe have blingie wardrobe swapping also, so why should this movie's bother me?Because it distracts from the already stressed-out plot. I wouldn't begrudge an ethnic or gender group the privilege to share the same insta-powers and unbelievable technology or give airtime to diversity (I'm still waiting for Colossus to come out!) but in this case, Marvel did the genre a disservice. Why oh why wasn't I consulted on these nuances?Just as Marvel Studio spent too much money on marketing, they spent too much money on focus groups. They are trying to appeal to a specific audience and yet maintain balance and it doesn't work. What could have been a beautiful and strong story ends up being overhyped, muddied, and ultimately ungraceful in the face of a diverse culture's own depth of flavor and strength.I agree with Roger Moore's Metacritic score of 63, and I still look forward to future additions to the Black Panther series, with hopefully more elegant approaches and culturally worthy scripting.Oh, and while the 'white boy' comment maybe culturally authentic, it was just as unwelcome as the 'n'-word.</review-text>

		<review-text>I watched Black Panther coz it's Valentine's Day, an important day in the Philippines. I was hoping that the critics' reviews are accurate. This has 98-100% on Rotten Tomatoes and the media is going bananas for this movie. It's an entertaining movie but extremely overrated.Expect the same formula from MCU. This movie mentions a lot from previous MCU movies that if you haven't watched them all, you'll be very confused like me. I don't understand some things being mentioned because this movie references the previous movies so much. The opening is good but the story drags that it becomes boring. The fight scenes are good but don't expect so much action from this film. The film is so predictable that I was yawning at some moments. And Marvel releases like 3-5 movies a year so the Marvel fatigue is real. The critics are suspicious. They should give this about 40-50% on RT. Don't trust the critics. Watch this if you want but I don't recommend seeing it theaters. I wanna give this 6 stars but to balance the overrated 10 stars, I will only give 1 star. If you're not a diehard MCU fan, skip the theaters.</review-text>

		<review-text>I went into BLACK PANTHER with high expectations and looking forward to a fresh and exciting new MCU franchise and for most of the film that was what I got. BLACK PANTHER began as a fun, new, superhero adventure romp with good acting, a fairly decent plot and brilliant visuals. Director Ryan Coogler, for the story of BLACK PANTHER has combined the old, tribal customs of Africa with fresh, new, brilliant technology and a mother load of vibraniam to create a fascinating MCU world. Wakanda is an amazingly colourful world brought to life with the great visual effects and natural scenery. It's looks almost like an African version of Coruscant from STAR WARS. The casting for the most part in this film is brilliant and almost every member is on great form and doing their uttermost. Boseman is obviously the main highlight in this film and gives a very convincing performance as T'Challa. We only caught a small glimpse of his true talent as Black Panther in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. In this film we get a much more thorough and fascinating look at the character with Boseman playing all his characteristics and emotions brilliantly and becoming a real hero we can care about. He's brilliantly complex and multi-layered and a very fun character to spend time with. The rest of the cast is on top form with the likes of Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira and several others. They gave real life to the characters and made them fun and interesting. There was one rather silly performance: Michael B. Jordan as the movie's main villain Erik Killmonger. It's not really his fault, it's more the writing. Killmonger as a character and as a villain is completely bland and two-dimensional. Jordan tries his best to save the role and make it convincing, but turns the part into more of a shouting act. On the other hand, it's disappointing that the great Andy Serkis is only made a MINOR villain as Ulysses Klaue. His character is dynamic, fun and really pops so it's a shame that he's &quot;offed&quot; so early.Now, onto one of the good things but also the problem of this film: the plot. To start, it's fun, action-packed and very entertaining. Coogler choreographs really brilliant action scenes that feel almost like something out of THE MATRIX at some points. It's a great ride with fairly fun characters and that's all great until we get into the 3rd ACT. The finale is possibly one of the worst endings to a movie I've ever seen and takes a real dump on the whole movie! It's so lazy and stupid and goes WAY beyond the far-fetched antics of the beginning with laser ships, giant rhinos and a VERY disappointing sci-fi battle on the planes. I'm not just saying this because it's set in Africa and involves big cats but the ending is THE LION KING on acid and not in a good way. The whole final battle revolves around Killmonger's plan and it's just SO silly and pointless and frankly something one would expect from the Red Skull. Danai Gurira as Okoye leads her warriors against the villains on the plains and it quickly turns into pure spear porn. The sins of this ending were just SO terrible and it was impossible to overlook them, and this sadly dragged the film down terribly and made it a convoluted, silly, sci-fi mishmash that ruined a perfectly good movie premise. This was a real disappointment when I had such hopes for this movie and had enjoyed it so far.Here's what I say: enjoy Black Panther's role in CIVIL WAR and leave it at that!</review-text>

		<review-text>Honestly, just a terrible movie. Overly generic plot and terrible acting. This is a landmark failure for MCU. Michael B Jordan doesn't have what it takes to be a villain at all. The movie makes use of what is basically BLM propaganda as the villain's agenda and I feel this has been done to try and evade harsh critical reviews, what a shame! Andy Serkis was just too brilliant, sadly the movie doesn't revolve around him. Countless cringe worthy moments as a result of poor dialogue writing. The romantic sub plot just doesn't work. Winston Duke (M'Baku) has a few memorable moments but the movie on the whole is entirely a forgettable experience. 4 stars only for visual effects and a select few actors who performed well.</review-text>

		<review-text>Okay so people have giving me a hard time for not liking this movie. It's not that I didn't like. It was an OKAY marvel movie. Just not a lot really happens. The plot is dull and predictable. The hype made it seem like it was going to be the best Marvel movie ever. That is false in my opinion - Thor Ragnorok and Guardians 2 were by far the best so far - full of action, humor, and good stories. Black Panther movie does not even do much for the cinematic universe as it all takes place in Wakanda. The end credit scenes do tie it in but that's it really. PROS :
-Good action scenes 
-Black Panther's sister (she is my new hero)CONS :
-Too Long
-Dull Plot - almost predictable
-Too much hype
-Lame villian choice (really Michael B Jordan as a threat ? )</review-text>

		<review-text>As far as the story goes, Black Panther was really interesting. Killmonger is definitely one of the better MCU villains. T'Challa was a great character. 
The acting was more or less good.. Andy Serkis was terrible to the point of absurdity. Bilbo just played Bilbo again. And Shuri wasn't really good.The action was to my surprise really poorly shot, especially the last fight.The soundtrack was amazing for the most part. It reminded me a lot of the Lion King opening. Except for one chase scene where it was distracting.CGI unfinished and you can easily tell. Prequel levels of bad. Humor doesn't land at all for me. Political messaging was okay and I didn't mind it at all. Apart from the post-credits scene it wasn't on the nose and actually presented nuance. It doesn't hinder the movie. &quot;Black Pride&quot; is not a thing, and if it is, it is presented as a bad thing, as the only characters that exhibit it were Killmonger and M'Baku. Ryan Coogler delivers on the story and characters, and you can see that careful thought was put into his vision and the script, however some of the technical aspects seem unfinished, and the humor was the worst out of any MCU film to date (humor is subjective). This leads me to believe that the film needed more time.
All in all it was a solid Marvel film, but nothing special.

		<review-text>The story of Black Panther is an ueber-generic-bubble, zillion times already told (wow, a villain wants to conquer a kingdom!), boosted with some CGI, some good, some mediocre, but like e.g. the new Star Trek s*ht called Discovery the magic is gone, and my brain melts almost into nothingness watching that kind of stuff called blockbuster today.Btw: a panther is always black. So a black panther is a tautology if I remember my terminology right. There are no white, green or red panthers in the to mankind known universe, there is only one exception I know about, and that's the famous Pink Panther! And he beats the Black Panther easy in humor, in storytelling, even the grade of violence is superior ;)I suspect there is a global conspiracy to kill all of mankind by boredom or mutate us into brain-dead zombies. But for my redamption and safety of my sanity I got some copies of Pink Panthers great adventures.Final words: Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam (Cato, the Elder).</review-text>

		<review-text>Unfortunately, February is where big budget mediocre/poor movies dwell. Black Panther fits this description. If this movie had not received the ridiculous build-up, it would have died quickly at the theaters. They had an interesting concept to work with, but I cannot remember when I have seen such uninspired, even boring, fight scenes. Nothing original other than location. One of the most predictable movies you will ever see. Watch the first 20 mins and you will know the rest of the story to the end. The one real bright spot of the film was Letitia Wrights portrayal of Shuri. She is a delight to view on screen. Hopefully, like Captain America, the first Black Panther will be considered a throw away, and they will get better in additional installments.</review-text>

	<review id="100">
		<review-text>I went into the movie with reasonable expectations, but feared that the 98% RT score was fabricated. As many reviews point out, my fear was realized as I truly believe critics fear giving a truthful rating due to the BS backlash they'd receive from the social media warriors of today. The action in the film was cool as was all the tech stuff, but the story was lacking. The villain of the film could have been better too. I think this movie could have benefited by connecting it more to the MCU - perhaps having a secondary hero like Bucky, or any applicable ones from Civil War play a role in this films plot. I understand there was a heavy political message behind the film, which is great, but in terms of a super hero movie, I felt this was the worst BY FAR at least in terms of the MCU.</review-text>

		<review-text>Th critics are either liars our were paid to say this was the best Marvel Movie, tis film comes NOWHERE CLOSE to films like the original Iron Man, Deadpool, or Logan. This was definitely an attempt the fashionable diversity quotas in Hollywood nowadays. Other than the ooh aah special effects, this film offered little substance than what was already on the surface. I get it, powerful African Americans and females are popular right now but this film just shoves it in your face, I was really turned off by it. I considered leaving the film about halfway through but figured I payed for it, might as well finish it.As I said the spectacles were are as to be expected with the wild high budgets of Marvel films. With that it had some unique special effects and wild rides that I suppose are worth the price of admission. But th story is just atrocious, poorly written and really did not suck me in. During scenes of dialogue I rolled my eyes and just waited for the next sequence of special effects. And again, I've got no problem with films about minority culture, I find them very interesting, but this was just in your face propaganda, it was just so terrible, I was truly turned off this film.I would say skip this trash.</review-text>

		<review-text>Am I getting to old for this, or did this movie look like &quot;If you do not agree with me you are dead and I can still be the good guy&quot; ... ??The bad guys of this movie are the ones who want to share what Wakanda have to the rest of the world... Wakanda operates in riches and people walk around in tailored suits while 99% of Africa is in the ruins and they claim to have been doing so for generations... If you have a problem with this, you are DEAD even if you are my brother or cousin or any other blood relative. Wakanda have flying ships, bullet trains, and markets swarming with people... so how big is wakanda and if it covers that much area to have bullet trains, why hasn't it been noticed so far?!? In all fairness, Kilmonger did win the throne fair and square... He didnt cheat, they fought and he won, hence getting the throne. He did not literally yet commit a crime in Wakanda to deserve death?? I mean couldn't they just tranquilize him and talk it out?? The so-called multi-purpose vibranium couldn't handle such a situation??They whole IDEA that the Black Panther can be switched on and off with a potion is stupid too!! And clearly anyone can walk in and steal those precious glowy flowers!!It is watchable, but just stupid story telling. Marvel can make good movies if they wanted... Spiderman Homecoming, Thor Ragnarok and Captain America Winter soldier, in that order, are still my favorites.</review-text>

		<review-text>Honestly, this is possibly the worst Marvel film that has been done to date. The cinematography and after effects were awful, the worst that Marvel has ever done, nothing looked polished and you can tell there was blue and green screens everywhere which is unlike every other Marvel film.For an Origins story, they didn't tell how this Native tribe became technologically advanced enough to start building things with Vibranium, and we are just meant to believe that a people in this situation can?The fight / car chase scenes were lacking a real punch which you could really get behind, and just a bit meh for a Marvel film - felt more like I was watching a Fox Marvel film than an MCU one.A number of the scenes also seemed to be copied from films like Thor Ragnarock - fight on the bridge, the panning into Wakanda very similar to panning into Asgard/Vallhallah, The CSI Agent is just Phil Colson in a new person, the pursuit scene after blowing up the jail was in Captain America.Overall the first Marvel film I have left the Cinema going meh.</review-text>

Black panther was one of the new ones that i was looking forward to but i tell you, what disappointment it turned out to be.Without spoilers, let me tell you, there is absolutely nothing that will make you stun or surprised or praise anything that you have not already watched in the trailer. Actually the trailer of this movie had almost all the cool scenes and thats it.NO action... just a mess all around. No integrity what so ever.. a 100% predictable movie from the first 5 mins. an over stretch of a first 2 mins of movie. THIS IS THE ONLY SUPER HERO MOVIE THAT I DID NOT EVEN WAITED TO SEE THE END OF CREDIT SCENES... !! Imagine how it boggled my brain... I had to come home and see Captain America - Civil War all again. Just to keep the Black Panther in saw in civil war, to keep that as his memory in my head and not this crappy s**t i saw ... There is something really wrong with the ratings now a days. I am surprised how such junk movies are being hyped till maximum.. I seriously have lost all faith on Critics and ratings... That is now all a business and game.. In last few years, soo many good movies have been dumped by critics and so many crappy movies have been hyped up the roof... What a shame..</review-text>

		<review-text>The initial reviews were so good for this movie that I felt compelled to see the movie in the theater. Viewing it in standard format was probably not the best choice, and it is quite possible I would have given it a higher rating after watching it on an Imax screen. The pros- Chadwick Boseman did a great job as the Black Panther. He was a strong character and was fun to root for. Some of the visuals were very well done. Many of the set designs are also effective. 
The cons- Michael B Jordan as Killmonger was not very good. His street accent was on the verge of comical. The CGI was not horrible but did get a bit much at times. The storyline was generic. Summary- I would recommend to see the movie, just do not waste the money to see it in the theater.</review-text>

		<review-text>The film was entertaining, but by no stretch is it Marvel's best piece. The main criticism I have is the lack of attachment to the main character. It's unfortunate, but I found myself caring more about the outcome of the villain than the Black Panther. I didn't actually care that much when he &quot;dies&quot; in his second challenge, because I was left thinking, to an extent, that he deserved it. What kind of country with so amazing technological innovation and wealth isn't run democratically? It seems almost like an oxymoron to have such powerful weapons and such a weak political system at the same time, but ah well. I guess that's Wakandan culture or something. In summary, the main issue to be resolved in the movie was preventable and stupid. But the rest of the film is pretty cool, so go watch it and make your own mind up</review-text>

		<review-text>People need to calm down, it's literally just another Marvel movie. Killmonger is a terrible villain and way to angry, makes no sense and literally just appears at the end as some sort of god and then reigns for 5 minutes executing a plan that makes no real correlation to the very lacking backstory of his rise. It could have done with a lot more there to make him not seem like just some dude. Let's see WHY he is called Killmonger. The visuals are awesome though, credit there. I can even ignore the nationalist dictator theme seeing as Black Panther is actually a decent person. Andy Serkis and Danai Girira and the visuals are really the only redeeming features, otherwise its typical cut and paste.Hero introduces himself
Hero has a crush
Hero is challenged
Hero is betrayed
Hero comes back
Hero asks for help, denied
Hero instigates battle - the non help arrives - OOH SURPRISE! Didn't see that coming
Hero wins
Heros friends all do the tasks in the nick of time before dying
Villain dies unceremoniouslyYes, it's good. But come on... calm down. It's no better or worse than any other Marvel adventure. It's good fun but it won't leave you guessing as to what happens or how it will pan out.Could do with less pity politics and virtue signalling and some real critiquing. There is a good opportunity to make a follow up even better and tie in the whole universe a bit more.</review-text>

		<review-text>This has to be by far the worst movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I will explain.The movie manages to have amazing visuals but it is highly political: and while i understand that works for some people I do not enjoy being hammered over the head with politics. Chadwick Boseman is good as ever as T'Challa and even the supporting Wakandan cast manages to do a good job, but Michael B Jordan's Kilmonger is absolutely one of the worst Comic Book Movie villains I have ever seen. Not only do they keep the formula of making the villain the hero's mirror opposite (which works more times than not) but the filmmakers try real hard for you to like, pity and feel sorry for such a horribly designed character whose main trait is being an awful, petty and vengeful human being.There is no real substance to the movie unless you wanna be deeply immerse into race politics, not my cup of tea to be honest. Which makes me give Black Panther a 5 out of 10, the lowest score I have ever given a movie from this saga.I did not enjoy it, I am not looking forward for a sequel, not even if Namor showed up.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther was a solid movie, but it's nowhere near what the critics are making it out to be. All of the special effects were very good, and the parts were acted very well. The problem is that it kind of lacked this groundbreaking substance that we're being led to believe is there. The concept is great, but I just didn't feel like there was adequate character development to get you really invested in the ideological clash and manner of resolution they were working toward. For that reason I didn't leave feeling as uplifted as I could have for the theme that was used. It was just kind of, &quot;oh, alright...well he's a really decent human being.&quot; I've read reviews that call this the best Marvel movie ever, those are NOT credible critics. There's no way. It's in the top ten, and it was better than a lot of other movies over the last couple of years, but come on. All of that being said, it's worth watching. but maybe just temper your expectations if you've only been following the &quot;big name&quot; reviewers.</review-text>

		<review-text>Despite a very good performance from Michael Jordan, who was a very strong &quot;bad guy&quot;, the movie was very non superheroish. I did like Danai as the general too, she definately was the part.They tried rather unsuccessfully to be humerous, there was the occasional attemp at lafter from the crowd, but very quietly.If the movie had not been a marvel superhero movie, despite its somewhat &quot;Lion king&quot; like storyline, it would have been a good story.But, its a marvel superhero movie, so wheres the superhero stuff ?I also thought it was a little on the violent side for younger kids, several people were shot dead in cold blood, another had their throat cut (though you dont see the knife slitting or blood, its obvious what has happened).It is also 2 1/4 hours long, and it feels like it.</review-text>

The main villain outshone the title character who was rather wooden similar to when he appeared in the previous movie.</review-text>

		<review-text>Alright, all we heard coming in to this movie was it was the best marvel movie ever made and we'll be treated to an incredible story to lead us into the holy grail which is Infinity War! Well.....we got NONE of that. first off, i should note i am a white male. that being said, i didn't find the movie as funny as majority of the theater did but i realize most of the jokes were not directed towards my demographic and i can live it and appreciate that. the visuals were stunning for the most parts (sometimes overdone as most movies like this tend to do). all the actors were great, although every time Michael B Jordan opened his mouth, i wanted to cringe. music and score is very very good. But lets call this movie what it is, a HUGE money grab and filler movie for Marvel before IW. The movie provides almost NOTHING in terms of story line in the MCU and we never see the soul stone?? tf is with that bs. final battle is not good, boring and predictable. and don't get me started about the post credit scenes. total BS who tf cares about Bucky Barnes. beyond let down with this movie. I think its great that Marvel made a role that empowers African Americans and gives them a super hero to look up to, but as a massive fan of the MCU its impossible to not be left with nothing but a sour taste in your mouth.</review-text>

		<review-text>Someone else nailed it. I go to movies to have fun. This one---re eh. Personally I say consider renting it. 
It's a little known hero. Not quite lighthearted enough for my taste. On one hand Tchula and the cast tried. On ther hand to be honest Thor Ragnorok for was simply more fun. Because it doesn't take it self seriuslly and was gloriusly fun.Imo it'd work as a rental, not so much as a go to the theater thing.</review-text>

		<review-text>Masterful job by Ryan Coogler and cinematographer Rachel Morrison as well as the entire cast. People complaining of politics in this film are suffering from delusions of their own making. Its a movie about a fictional king in a fictional country. True Marvel fans will know that you can't tell the story of BP without the origins and practices of Wakanda. Anyway, Michael B. Jordan (No relation) plays the realest villain since Magneto. (Another character whose anger comes from a real place) Enjoyed Jordan in Creed and liked the character. Which made it hard to accept him as a bad guy. However he quickly made me change my mind as the menacing Killmonger. 
In short see the movie for what it is, another Marvel hit, this time with a different spin that will bring a new base of fans to the Marvel dynasty.</review-text>

		<review-text>SO Incredibly overhyped!!!! This could have been a B movie if it wasnt in theatres. The was little explanation of the bizarre lore and cool tech. 
the characters behaved in very conventional dramatic comic book ways. 
the humor was uninteresting,
the african-ness of it was ratcheted up to an awkward level. 
Its not the first black superhero movie, Blade and Hancock are only a couple of examples that came before.
frequently confused by story. 
reminds me of lion king. who will be king of africa?
superhero is a mix of high tech iron man suit, spiderman gymnastics, and wolverine claws but adds nothing new.
theyll call you racist if you dont like it. see RT critics reviews</review-text>

		<review-text>I'm from Asia and I don't understand the discrimination and racial crisis of Blacks and Whites in US. So I went to see the movie expecting it to be another good movie from MCU ( you have to admit they do have a good track record). And what I got instead was pure gold. 
I have never seen Africa and African culture depicted in such a beautiful way in a live action movie. Hollywood movies always paint Africa in colors that matches its name under British colonization, &quot;The Dark Continent&quot;. We see movies of slave trade, blood soaked diamond industry, starvation and poverty. I've always wondered this can't be all that Africa has to offer. Though it is based in a mythical country and superpowers, it gave us a glimmer of what Africa would have looked like if European and middle eastern invaders sucked it dry of it's resources. In black panther we see a world set in Africa with bare minimal of those usual stereotypes about the continent. It is a breath of fresh air.The splash of color was a balm to the eyes and music, well i might need to write another review about how good music in this movie was. The end credits score for the movie was phenomenal.
Every character had his\her moment to shine. And all the actors did their characters justice. Black Panther's little sister Shuri was a delight to watch. Micheal B Jordan as the Killmonger was exceptional and up their with Loki when it comes to Marvel villains.</review-text>

		<review-text>****Spoiler Alert ***** DO NOT read if you don't want to know the story line! Black Panther had loads of potential, mainly due to the fact that the Super hero was not from America. I'm not saying that I don't like Super heroes from America, I do and I love them, however, the with BP film makers had a different back story to work with and had a real opportunity to produce something really creative and really different within the Marvel Universe; but did they? .....No!The story writers kept the film within a safe and regularly used story line frame work. Here's the frame work:
1. The parent (mother or Father) keeps some dark secret from the the son/daughter.
2. The parents(s) wanted to tell their off spring but never did, due to either dying or being killed earlier than they anticipated.
3. Throw in some dangerous element or threat or villain.... in this case the metal Vibranium which some bad guys are after and fill a portion of the film with chase scenes and explosions.
4. Then go back to the dark secret... in this case the father killed the brother and left the brothers son in American
5. The brothers son grows up vowing to take his bitter revenge.
5. The bitter revenge is then taken by the son and tries to kill our hero in this case its BP. Everyone thinks hes dead ....but hes not!! (Surprise!!)
6. Our hero (BP) goes to a his life time enemies (in this case the Ape tribe in Wakanda) to asks them for help (the life time rivalry could be a rival gang or child friend who he/she fell out with due a fight over a girl or money... in this case its the Vibranium)
7. The life time enemies say No, No way will I ever help you!!....... But guess what they come to save the day, just in the nick of time....
8. They all live happily ever after!Hollywood on occasion put movies that breaks the above framework and other similar frameworks... but it is rare and Black Panther is most certainly not one of the exceptions and unfortunately, has its fundamental story line built solidly within the framework.Did I like the movie, Yes. Did I love the movie, &quot;almost&quot;.... I love Marvel and DC (Ok ... I'm a sucker for the genre)My Point is this - Hollywood spends billions developing CGI and non CGI special effects ever year - it is high time that they start investing the same time and effort to create a rich and original story line that justifies the budget of the movie</review-text>

		<review-text>Okay so I love Marvel movies and I was really excited for this one as the trailer looked awesome and because the hype seemed good.However I was sadly disappointed. I had an empty feeling when I came out of the cinema as I felt it could have been so much better. This is my unbiased opinion. I really wanted it to be good and awesome and different.There were good points. I liked Chadwick Boseman as the black Panther and there were great visuals and colours throughout the movie. However I wanted a bit more from T'Challa and the plot was pretty weak and many of the characters were under developed. I feel with many other Marvel movies they try to at least make the characters and concepts somewhat plausible but this one fell short.I mean ok I can accept that they got their power from vibranium which came from a meteor but like it didn't give any feeling of how they utilised it to the extent they had and Shuri just seemed so wooden. She looks like 16 or not much older and is supposed to be super intelligent tech woman with all this out of this world stuff, but she did not come across as a believable character in her field of expertise. She just came across like a teen who tried too hard to be funny. I mean at least with Tony Stark and Bruce Banner you get a feel for why they are so clever.Also the villain was bland and I was hoping for more street action outside Wakanda and many of the Wakanda people seemed flaky, like W'kabi. Some of the African accents were a bit off too.If you like most Marvel movies you will still probably enjoy it but don't expect it to be as good as the hype makes it out to be.</review-text>

		<review-text>This movie didn't do justice for Black Panther while it was an ok movie it was boring at best and predictable, but I didn't expect much from Marvel on this one they seam to have trouble on origin movies (Cap America the first Avenger and Thor 1 and some what Thor 2 as well they were boring also). Well I hope we get a Black Panther 2 with a better villain and no family drama.</review-text>

		<review-text>The latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is &quot;Black Panther&quot;, the first Marvel film featuring a predominantly black cast. Black Panther first appeared in &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;, with Chadwick Boseman donning the suit of Black Panther, and alter-ego T'Challa, King of Wakanda, a technologically advanced nation hidden in the African continent. After the death of his father, T'Challa, son of T'Chaka, the King, takes the place of the throne, faced with obstacles as soon as he is initiated. Andy Serkis plays Ulysses Klaue, a mercenary stealing technology from Wakanda and selling it, is one of the main antagonists of the picture, giving a fantastic performance as a nonchalant, cockney thief, escaping the claws of the previous king, and now hunted by Boseman. In fact, what makes this film stand-out, is the back-up cast. The sister of T'Challa, played by Letitia Wright, and a clan leader, played by Winston Duke, are two characters who particularly stand-out, and serve as comic-relief for parts of the film. Whereas on the other side of the film, with Chadwick Boseman, are phenomenal pieces of lightning and choreography in a lot of his early battle sequences, paired with a purple-glowing suit (possibly the best suit produced by the MCU for any hero), any action sequence featuring him is exciting and awesome, especially the early battles, where the audience is introduced to the power of the Black Panther, discovering just why this guy is a hero. Speaking of costumes, the costumes of the citizens of Wakanda all vary in colour, being interesting and obviously well made. Despite this, it seems as if the costumes are trying to &quot;spread the colour&quot; with some, obviously blatant scenes of (costume) colour segregation. This is not helped by CGI which is successful for the majority, but falls short at the scenes of actual animal life, i.e. rhinos. Even though &quot;Black Panther&quot; is home to some of the best choreography for a Marvel film, the script lets itself down, with a dragged out plot and unnecessary sequences of &quot;falling only to rise once more&quot; (both literally and metaphorically). From the get go, one thinks, this is close to being one of the best Marvel films of all time, but, short of falling flat on its face, it stumbles over its own plot annoyances, making it equal to &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; and &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2&quot; when it had the capability to surpass &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; and &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; (although it would have had to be extremely good for that to happen).</review-text>

		<review-text>Problems arise from every aspect of film making. Character wise the two villains and Shuri were the strongest, yet as expected of a mcu movie they kill off the villains and Shuri is pushed towards annoying at the turn of the film, showcased with the outdated 'what are those' scene. Sadly this was probably the worst Martin Freeman character I have seen personally. The movie does attempt to do something new but then always pulls the rug away and reverts back to the standard formula continuously. The accents in the movie fluctuated madly which really took me out of it, funnily enough of the one to get it wrong Freemans accent was by far the most changing. The tech in the movie is misconstrued, somehow while Klaws arm can defeat BPs suit Shuri's most improved power ranger arms do little to KIllmonger at all. The cgi is also an area for concern and the movie couldve prospered more from a real life shot. Of course Marvel ruined strong scenes by adding one-liners to the end which really made many of the so called leaders and professionals of the film come off in a very childish manner unbecoming of their positions (free pass to Shuri as she of course was a child). Killmongers plan which probably sounded good at a first pitch really falls apart once you consider anything remotely about it, be it the fact that Wakanda only has 4 planes to transport the weapons and said planes take a silly amount of time to reach the outer limits which is just lazy writing in terms of timing.
Onto the good stuff,the easiest thing to state is the cultural representation which is showcased continuously throughout the movie. The two villains are both very good, of course Klaw taking the first half, and Killmonger taking the latter (of course this being easier with the other no longer around haha, which was needed since Klaw was a stronger character but didnt have the philosophical reasoning to fight like Killmonger). Lastly the basis of the philosophy of the film works wonders and carries it even though the philosophy never really improves upon the basis in any meaningful way.</review-text>

This movie according to me was complete disaster the director forgot the actually concept of the movie and the universe they are in . It is not a documentary movie where your trying to give social message to people. I understand it was about black community and respect that but. Ryan Coogler forgot and was trying just portray about social understanding and this movie is not at all about social message its all about Avengers,the Superhero whom we love to watch .movie was just emotional drama i fell like i wasted my weekend and my excitement of black panther which i was waiting form very long time and what i was expecting there was nothing such happening in the movie .and Please do-not compare (Erik Killmonger) to (Loki) Killmonger looked like a circus freak to me . Director did not use Micheal Jordan very well it was Directors mistake ... 2-Stars

		<review-text>This is one of the movies you sit through and really get stuck to the movie and never get bored because it's so entertaining and you don't even feel the time flies by.This is the most recent highest budget movie marvel has produced since Civil War.It cost 200 million dollars to make this movie means there's gonna be lots of scenes with heavily packed action plus great special effects.The acting and the story is great enough to make you forget about you're in the movies and not to care about any critical stiff you've heard about this movie.
This really has a different vibe than any marvel movie you've ever watched.This more is more sophisticated with a superhero with a net worth of 500 Billion dollars and he's got great costumes that'll make you get goose bumps.
This is highly recommended and you should really watch this movie even if you don't feel like watching it because you're gonna have to catch up on everything before the Infinity War hit the movies.</review-text>

		<review-text>Some people might fight this film enjoyable, like kids maybe? but as I watched it in the cinema, even they were bored most of the time. Could this be my reason for walking out ..well maybe, after all nobody likes noisy people around them whether or large or small whilst trying to pay attention to something, but I can certainly say it wasn't my only reason for walking out. Maybe teenagers are the target audience, or adults gripping to childhood.This among other Marvel and DC releases was as I suspected it would be; An over-animated mess without much sense other than to showboat over-priced CGI, over-done sound effects and over-compensated actors. The only decent aspect in all of this was the incredible wide angle scenic shots that could only look better if I were not to be in a cinema, but in nature properly being in these landscapes myself.There are some neat ideas in the film, but if they're only made tangible by the before-mentioned budget, then this indicates a lack of imagination in viewers since a lot of these ideas like magnetic railways could be made far more common place if only we put our money to better use rather than it going to an over-inflated box office for people to sit in a cinema grazing on fat, salt and sugar to take their mind away from the job and bills they hate so much. This film, not unlike 90% of others gives us a glimpse of what is possible by working together, not without question, but with care &amp; dignity ..unlike the current modalities that have such a grapple hold on our Earth at the moment.</review-text>

		<review-text>Great film. Chadwick and Michael B. killed it. Killmonger is the 3rd best villain behind Loki and Vulture in the MCU for me. BP had the right balance of tech and mysticism.Danai, Letitia, and Winston were my highlights. Their comedy was at the right tone for me. Not slapstick, not over-the-top, not snarky. Just subtle enough to keep you smiling.Must also give a shout out to Ryan Coogler. You have delivered something beautiful. I hope we see an announcement for BP2 just after Infinity War.I'm glad that people have differing opinions on this film because there are flaws. Pretending they're not there is being disingenuous. It's why I didn't give the film a 10/10.I don't like that Klaue was wasted in the way he was. He was expertly teased in Ultron and was brilliant in the first half of BP, but then, he's shot and he's dead? It was almost as criminal with what they did to Crossbones in Civil War.The CGI/fight scenes were blurry and hard to follow in parts.Forest Whitaker has to stop taking roles where he dies.But on the other hand, making out that this film ruined your childhood, hurt society and is simply Disneyfied dross says more about the reviewer than the film.I must admit though, seeing one review comparing Black Panther to Happy Feet made me laugh.</review-text>

		<review-text>I'm not here to give a 10 stars review so that the general grade can increase, because that would not be really helpful looking at the real quality of the movie. I did however rate is with 1, so that the grate can reach a rating that is closer to the one this movie deserves. Not based on the fact that people tend to rate this movie based on the politics and ethnic racial war (which should never, ever interfere with any movie in general), but for what the movie really offers to it's fans. There are better movies out there that are rated way worse than this one. If you objectively look at this movie, you can see that is not worth more than a 6.5. Maybe if you are a MARVEL fan a 7. That's because the movie was lacking in action. The movie wasn't too much about the Black Panther but the tech that he had. The character didn't had the space to built itself which is such a shame considering the fact that that was what the movie was all about!! It would have been awesome to see more action from the panther, to have scenes where you can see all those amazing skills that he posses..the movie had the space to make this hero look way cooler that it did. Shame...</review-text>

		<review-text>Marvel's Black Panther origin movie was a given since the character was introduced to MCU audiences in Captain America Civil War, the hype for Black Panther was incredible however the movie didn't deliver. I believe that Chadwick Boseman aka Black Panther half arsed the role, his voice kept changing and he seemed to be rejecting some of the lines he said, he felt like a completely different character from Captain America Civil War. I was rather disappointed with how there were minimal references to the MCU story line which with Avengers Infinity War so close you'd think there would at least be one. Overall the action in the movie was fantastic and exciting just like your typical Marvel movie should be, however the movie was let down by the acting by the protagonist and side characters.</review-text>
		<review-title>Didn't believe the acting</review-title>
	</review>
	<review id="142">
		<review-text>The fact that the film's rating continues to climb despite the organized efforts to bring down it's rating is a testament to how good this movie really is. I went in fairly skeptical - I'm not into comic books and am not familiar with the Black Panther series at all. I also haven't seen Creed or Fruitvale Station so I'm not familiar with the director's work. As we were stepping out of the theater I was almost speechless, the best I could say at the time was &quot;there are a LOT of things I loved about that.&quot;The first thing that came to mind at the time, was the wonderful portrayal of Shuri by Letitia Wright and she's a good place to start...As the plot is being constructed, shortly into the film, we are introduced to King T'Challa's younger sister, the brilliant Shuri in a role that defies all the typical 'nerd girl' cliches (she's self assured in all ways, enthusiastic to the point of exuberance,and completely ready to take the fight on herself) - she takes her brother on a tour of her lab showing him all the new tools and inventions she's come up with to help on their mission - the scene is an unabashedly loving take on the classic &quot;Q and Bond&quot; sequences from James Bond. 
The Bond feel then carries over into the next scene in a South Korean casino, which culminates in the best choreographed fight scene to date in any Marvel film. 
This then carries into a car chase sequence that continues to pay reference to Bond - in just the first viewing I caught references to both Brosnan and Moore era films in the car chase alone. Outside of that aspect of the filmmaking, every other aspect of this movie is also very nearly perfect;
The world of Wakanda is so well built and the supporting characters are so much fun and so well done I could see this being the foundation of a long and varied franchise. I can think of three spin-offs I'd love to see. 
The overall storyline is the most original to date in the Marvel Universe - especially for a 'tentpole' film.
The villain, Michal B Jordan, is one of the most menacing and yet fully realized villains for Marvel - it's been said that the villain is the hero in his own story and this couldn't be more true than in this film. 
The dialog is fast, brilliant, and daring.The final words spoken by Michael B Jordan, towards the end of the film, are the heaviest, darkest and most meaningful words spoken in any of these Marvel films. The line is so raw and honest and devastating I forgot I was watching a Disney-produced comic book film. This is an exceptional film - ignore all the phony reviews here, give up preconceptions or misplaced feelings of being 'left out' of a 'black movie'. The pitiable and ineffectual racists who feel the need to blast this movie without seeing it are perhaps the ones who need to see it the most.</review-text>

		<review-text>With his father T'Chaka having passed away, T'Challa finds himself as heir to the throne of Wakanda and responsible for leading his people as the new king-a role which he is reluctant to embrace. He returns home to prepare for his coronation until he finds his sovereignty challenged by both internal and external factions, and must seek help from some unlikely sources to prevent a conflict which could have global repercussions. Innovative, well-crafted, and culturally significant entry to the Marvel Universe is a feast for the eyes with beautiful, breathtaking scenery, strong, captivating characters, but most importantly it's a very personal and compelling story with political overtones and serious, penetrating questions about the modern world. Though the pace lags at times it still holds your attention and is perfectly cast across the board with Boseman poised and centered in the lead, Jordan matching him as a physically imposing counterpart, along with Nyong'o, Guiria, and Wright who are all terrific.</review-text>

		<review-text>I want to start this by saying that &quot;Black Panther&quot; is a very important film in terms of representation. This is also one of the only movies I have ever seen that introduces the audience to a new culture that feels like I could actually described afterwards. 
The soundtrack is amazing and really helps the transitions feel smooth and adds to the action sequences.However this movie has a pacing issue that results in it feeling like two films that were pushed together. The second half of this movie is definitely better than the first for the simple reason that Michael B. Jordan gets to shine as killmonger, one of the best villains that the series has had so far. 
The casting in this movie is brilliant with the interactions between Boseman and Jordan towards the end being what is most memorable about the experience. 
The pacing issues cannot be overlooked however and the fight scenes were a little disappointing given Coogler pervious work on &quot;Creed&quot; 
A very enjoyable film overall and a welcome addition to the MCU.</review-text>

		<review-text>The 18th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is another solid entry to the franchise but It's a testament to how far Marvel have pushed the concept of a &quot;Superhero film&quot; in the last couple of years that &quot;Black Panther&quot;, which would have been amazing as little as three years ago, now feels a bit out-dated. Following the death of his father during &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;, T'Challa returns to Wakanda to be crowned its new King. He discovers that agents both within and outside of his homeland believe that the country should be doing more with their advanced science and technology to help the oppressed around the world. At the same time, Wakanda's most wanted, the only man to see hidden treasures and escape its borders, Ulysses Klaue, commits a daring robbery and may finally be vulnerable to capture. It's a beautiful looking film, and feels authentic to the region, even though Wakanda is a fictional land. Its debates about the morality of interference outside its feels like a genuine cause of conflict and Killmonger, excellently played by Michael B Jordan, is a villain whose motivation you believe in, even if the MCU's villain was/is family to the hero trope is again in force. However, I did find myself feeling at times that it was a bit po-faced, especially when compared to last years near comedies of &quot;Spider-man: Homecoming&quot; and &quot;Thor Ragnorok&quot;, though the times when it is funny, usually revolving around Letitia Wright as T'Challa's younger sister - Shuri - usually hit the mark. Another criticism I'd have for the film would be the editing, particularly in the earlier fight scenes. Modern action films are plagued by fight scenes shot too tight on the participants, which creates for a kinetic energy but, to my taste, makes it difficult to determine what's actually happening. Fortunately, for me, this stopped in the later fight scenes. Also, and very unusually for the MCU films, the CGI is occasionally a little subpar, particularly in the climactic battle. Though not breaking into my personal top five films of the MCU, there is much to enjoy with the characters and plenty of story scope for Black Panther 2.</review-text>

		<review-text>I guess if you like the other typical Marvel material then I guess you'll like this. The Marvel movies of today are mostly just cartoons for adults, and Black Panther isn't really any different. At various points in the movie I was able to call what was going to happen, play by play. &quot;Here comes another PG13, CGI action sequence&quot;.In terms of all of political hub-bub, I'm not really going to comment on that except to say I'm not sure why *anyone* is pretending like there has never been a movie starring a black dude before. Who knows.Aside from the dumb jokes and derivative visual effects, director Ryan Coogler was also cool enough to make sure to shoot all of the fight scenes with shaky cam, a la every movie from 2005-2009. Like I said, it's not for me, but if you happen to like the newer batch of Marvel movies, then knock yourself out.</review-text>

		<review-text>I left the theater with mixed feelings. Although the special effects were great, the story was just another cookie cutter Marvel version of yet another superhero with really no fresh ideas or design. On top of that, the action was just average or the same to any other previous Marvel movies. I'm sorry but it didn't blow me out of the water. The hype was just that, all hype. Even Michael B. Jordan could not save this movie from the dull and monotonous of the plot. And I wanted to like this movie so much! But it failed in so many ways. I left feeling so disappointed!</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is certainly a good movie, but I don't feel like it truly capitalizes on its interesting premise and setting enough to elevate above other Marvel movies. It still follows the formula and doesn't stray far enough away from it to make truly distinct. However, I did love the action scenes (which there was surprisingly little of), Michael B Jordan as Killmonger (surprisingly good villain to be honest), pretty much all the Wakanda stuff, the soundtrack and the core story. I just wish it had been less restricted by the studio. Black Panther is a good film, but it could've been a great one, which is disappointing.</review-text>

		<review-text>I was really psyched for the next MARVEL movie! Now, I wish I never saw it.
The acting was pretty good, although I would rather have unknowns than big names in these roles.
The character's names were so over the top that there was no way to keep them straight and that made me never have a good connection to any of those characters. 
The politics woven into the story line was obvious, bipolar and insulting. Shame on the writers for promoting racism and blame. 
Choreography was poor. There were several chronological mistakes 
I would have given it 0 stars but the costuming and scenery were lovely.</review-text>

		<review-text>The hype surrounding Marvel's newest cinematic instalment was stratospheric. A predominantly African-American cast and crew generated the initial publicity, then a knockout trailer turned that buzz into genuine excitement. Perhaps with such high expectations it was always going to be difficult for writer-director Ryan Coogler to deliver; the timely political themes, big-budget blockbuster requirements and Marvel connectivity all vying for his attention. Let's get the bad news out of the way: the action is underwhelming. There are a few decent sequences-a casino showdown boasts an ambitious unbroken tracking shot, a ritualistic cliff-side clash between two major characters is brutal-however, the set pieces largely leave a lot to be desired. Majority of the action is a blur of choppy editing and dimly lit cinematography, making it hard to appreciate both the choreography and geography of the fighting, whilst the finale is a disappointingly banal battle featuring, wait for it, CGI rhinos. Where this movie thrives though, is in its story and characters. Undoubtedly the MCU's most politically relevant instalment, the central plot revolves around oppression, equality, power-sharing and class, all tied up into a potent narrative that gives its characters room to breathe and grow. As the eponymous hero from Wakanda, Chadwick Boseman is endearing as a confident but conflicted King T'Challa, while his opposing force Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) is riveting as an unstoppable tornado of fury and revenge. Yet this film also gives us three of the strongest female characters of the franchise: Lupita Nyong'o as royal spy Nakia, Danai Gurira as fierce warrior Okoye, and Letitia Wright as exuberant tech-wizard Shuri. More often than not it's this trio who make the sound decisions, save the hero and kick some serious arse. Credit to Coogler and his crew for successfully weaving in so much African culture too. The stunning production design and costuming combines traditional African symbology with the high-tech world, whilst the score is a low-key fusion of hip-hop, customary African tunes and standard orchestral overtones. Its social and political commentary gives Black Panther a pertinence and edge most MCU flicks don't have, but as an action blockbuster it's merely mid-tier Marvel.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is definitely a great movie and a must watch for superhero fans as well as marvel fans. I don't understand all the negative reviews, its obvious some are just DC fans hating on the movie and some people are just nitpicking very small things, but of course the movie does have flaws. I am a big Marvel fan and a very big fan of the MCU, when I go to see movies in theaters I normally have high expectations as many people do, with Black Panther I did as well. What makes a movie good is different between every single person though i have very high expectations as long as the movie has a good plot, great fight scenes and characters I will be impressed whether i have high expectations or not. Black Panther had a good plot, it does not bore you and keeps you interested but it isn't unique it can be predictable and a bit cliche but throughout the movie i was very interested and wanted to carry on watching . The whole idea of &quot;Wakanda&quot; is great and is different from normal superhero movies.Characters are very great in this movie, Chadwick Boseman's character T'Chala was great through out the whole movie, he showed that he wanted to be king and had great chemistry between other characters. Considering T'Chala was introduced in Civil War he's character was developed but through Black Panther he's character develops slowly. Chadwick Boseman once again was excellent playing the character. The Villain Erik Kill-Monger was really good he was intimidating and he's ambitions were clear, although it was slightly cliche he was fantastic! Michael B Jordan did an amazing job and acting was good throughout. I don't want to make this too long but characters had good chemistry between each others and are very likable.To summarize this movie the plot was good,characters were fantastic because they had a good casting choice as well as brilliant chemistry among each other, fight scenes were bad ass and make you love the character BP even more.the jokes throughout this movie are not overused and not forced its just the good old marvel humor as well as the script was well written. Of course this movie did have it flaws the final fight scene between the protagonist and antagonist was disappointing and heavy CGI was used and it was obvious the characters were full CGI and the fight could have been much better. (also forgot to mention CGI was great in the movie at times it wasn't the best but shouldn't bother you) there was probably a few plot holes and predictable at times but didn't bother me too much.Overall the movie was fantastic and you should watch it, of course there are flaws but to me it did not bother me and i was entertained throughout, as I said before we all look differently to movies I said I have high expectations and the movies flaws did not make the movie bad for me but that's usually for most movies. Go watch this movie, lives up to the hype and you will love the character BP more!</review-text>
		<review-title>A Fantastic Movie! Definitely a must watch! WAKANDA FOREVER!!</review-title>

		<review-text>A definitely more diverse approach to the superheroes universe of Marvel. I welcomed this like a breeze of fresh air, and not only because of the aforementioned diversity of the characters but because of the quality of the movie as such. After being misrepresented lately by dull and ridiculous movies like the last installments of Captain America and Thor, the famous entertainment company can now promote Black Panther as a good sign of recovery.Well acted, fun, humorous and passionate movie. This time Marvel allocates the epic and eternal battle of good and evil in the African continent, having its people as the protagonists of the story. Combining science fiction and fantasy, the decently written script leads the spectators through a well passed course of actions, supported with outstanding visual effects and a colorful and imaginative depiction of a richly recreated African universe.A most welcome addition to a cinematic universe in need of fresh renovation.</review-text>

		<review-text>This has been touted as a fantastic film by numerous critics, but I found it to be a pretty average Marvel movie. That is not to say it is bad, because there are many things that it does right. The soundtrack is easily the most interesting of any film in the MCU, as it uses a combination of typical superhero/action movie score, African tribal music, and modern hip-hop that blends very well together. Also, the acting and characters are done very well, with three standout performances. Lupita N'yongo is great, Andy Serkis is exuberant, and Michael B. Jordan portrays one of the most interesting villains in the MCU. His character has a lot of depth and he provides a great foil with a potent motivation that is presented as pretty obvious social commentary. But even though it is on-the-nose, I did appreciate that the film actually attempted to get political. However, it is not without flaws. The first half drags a bit with a mix of dialogue-heavy scenes and generic action scenes. In fact, the action scenes throughout the film, save for the car chase and a fight between Kilmonger and Black Panther, are very bland. The filmmakers tried to recreate the same style of action that worked so well in The Winter Soldier, but they fell flat with some poor lighting, lack of grit, and CGI overload (particularly at the end). Overall, the movie is presented in a very generic way, with many of the same beats you would expect from every other superhero movie in the cinematography and editing. Despite these issues, I thought the positives outweighed the flaws and that the movie was an entertaining experience. I'd give it a strong 6/10.</review-text>

		<review-text>As a marvel fan who began reading comics in the early 1970's, Black Panther was a name I had known for decades but even at this high point was a minor character, but like Captain America, whom I had little interest in, my interest in both characters changed following the movies. With that reason and T'Challa's presence in Civil War, I had very high hopes for this movie... The good: the cast is charismatic and works well together in most cases, even Boseman's delivery as he grapples with his move to king works well. The near break-out character is his sister, who is easily the most animated and gets the best lines in the movie. Vistas of Africa and inside the Wakanda capital are impressive and great eye-candy for a time. A thematic plea that we are all more alike than different and should be better people is present which frankly we all need more, which brings the films worst failing - more on that later. The bad: actors clearly were locked into roles without much input, the feel in most cases was very wooden at times, even Boseman which is a shame as his extra dimensions in Civil War helped put it over the top. The set designs are good, but the CGI is rough by current standards, and in typical Marvel budget much of the fighting is at night, to reduce costs, a real shame as Black Panther looked awesome in full daylight combat in Civil War. The story as many have noted is just rote... but hey, it IS a Marvel movie so...The ugly: for a film that purports to make a statement about moving to one human tribe, it is unconscionable that the two main white characters are portrayed as either evil post-colonial opportunists, or at best a stumbling federal agent who is so out of touch despite his connections to the events of Civil War that he is just dumbstruck and unable to comprehend quickly the state of Wakanda. Two light anti-white racial pejoratives were thrown around, which undermines the movies message of moving forward and not grouping people and making assumptions or unfair associations. At its simplest, Black Panther is a very routine Marvel origin movie, overlayed with a well thought out sociological black diaspora politic analysis it all with a nod towards greater unity and an ascendant Africa, which makes its willingness to allow and in effect condone anti-white stereotyping all the more annoying. See it for the overall message, and be willing to realize that like society in general, it's not quite as advanced as it thinks it is.</review-text>

		<review-text>First let me say that from a philosophical standpoint, this was Marvel's best movie hands down. The argument as to whether a nation as powerful as Wakanda has the right to remain an isolationist nation; or the moral obligation to help those other struggling nations around them was very thought provoking. The movie was very well acted with Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger being the standout in the cast.  The action and special affects were top flight.. It had just the right amount of humor so as to add levity to film without turning it into a complete comedy like most Marvel films tend to do. I will likely be going to see this once more at the theater and it will definitely be added to the dvd collection as soon as it drops.</review-text>

		<review-text>Spoilers coming! I left the theater feeling underwhelmed. I'd felt this way after Spiderman, too; just wasn't enough tension or maybe it was over-hyped. The worst part is that the trailers for this movie revealed the best of the special effects and fights. As the movie went on, the coolest effects were already exposed and that took the wind right out of the sails. Then, couple that with &quot;Infinity Wars&quot; teasers that show T'Challa alive and well and interacting with Captain America, we already knew that he was coming out alive and still King of Wakanda. Plus, the later teaser reveals Bucky is hidden in Wakanda; we could easily and safely assume that wherever Cap is, he's not far from Bucky. The politics took more of the steam from this film, too. It had the smell like the Anakin Trilogy from Star Wars (Eps 1, 2, &amp; 3), where we are subjected to an imaginary C-SPAN. The slow downs didn't make the movie as exciting as previous MCU movies.They didn't really tie this one into the MCU as well as others. I could have really enjoyed a couple Avenger cameos here. Plus, they had a prime opportunity to bring them in with the time line being right after &quot;Civil War&quot;. Now, all that said, I enjoyed the movie overall. I'd watch it over all the DC movies, save Wonder Woman. It was entertaining, the suspense just wasn't there. Maybe, I had built it up too much in my head. Ant-Man and Dr. Strange were two of my favorites not knowing anything about their characters and I hoped Black Panther would do the same. In the end, I was disappointed but it was still worth watching. Here's hoping the next one picks up the momentum of the franchise.TL</review-text>

		<review-text>After his appearance in Captain America civil war I was so excited to see Black panther reappear and I have now seen this film and i really enjoyed it. The premise of the film sees prince t'challa return to the secluded technologically advanced african country of wakanda to become king, when he is challenged with threats foreign and domestic. Chadwick boseman reprises the role as t'challa and He is fantastic in the role, he plays the charismatic leader very well but even more he delivers a great mix of humour and drama to this rich character. The supporting cast is one of the best assembled in marvel history so let's start with Michael b Jordan who plays the villain in this film and I found his characters journey to be one of the more interesting parts in the film and made me care about the conflict between him and t'challa. Lupita nyongo plays a love interest in this film but she is a very strong character, also her and bosemans chemistry is really good in this film and you enjoy there flirting. Danai guirra of walking dead fame plays the head of the kings guard and she is great in this film, she is great in the majority of action scenes and is a well fleshed out character in this film. In my opinion the show stealer in this film and most surprising performance by Letitia Wright who plays his sister Shuri in this film, she isbhis tech specialist and I just loved her charm and she really added a lot of energy to her role to make her such a likeable character. Martin Freeman, Andy serkis, Angela Bassett and forest Whittaker all do well in there smaller roles. The story has a great coming of age story here for t'challa and it is really interesting to see this countries uniqueness and there tribes diversity. I also liked the way the villain tied to the hero as it felt real and personal to watch. But there is a portion of the story I didn't really like which I can't talk about due to spoilers. The script has a brilliant mix of humour and drama that gave this film the best of both worlds, it was funny when it needed to be but dramatic when it needed to be. The style of the film has some really unique looking sets with great use of technology and colours to make this film stand out. Though I feel like especially towards the end of the film the action relies overly on CGI and it doesn't look that good especially for a film in 2018. Overall black panther is a great film that should be seen especially if you love these marvel movies.</review-text>

Nobody gets upset about Iron Man and the highly-advanced weapons and high-technological weapons that he uses, it's the same thing with Black Panther.

		<review-text>Black Panther is hands down, one of the best superheroes spin-off movies of all time! It delivers a witty, action-packed epic moments and brings a vibrant twist to the comic book movie formula while remaining true to the Marvel Universe it belongs to.It tells the story of T'Challa who, after the events of &quot;Captain America: Civil War,&quot; returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as King. However, when an old enemy reappears on the radar, T'Challa's mettle as King and Black Panther is tested when he is drawn into a conflict that puts the entire fate of Wakanda and the world at risk.Okay, even if you are not a fan of superhero movies... you may find the issues explored thought-provoking. It is well acted, dazzlingly shot by an expert cinematographer Rachel Morrison and full of humour. Black Panther is an untold story in modern cinema; a story about black people completely untouched by colonialism, who exist entirely outside the global systems of institutionalized racism.This movie has a fast beating heart because it ain't just sincere for good sake but it is a heartfelt epic that doesn't fall flat. It's the kind of art that's star-strikingly theatrical, but not even for a moment does it feel forced.The score is authentic, the movie has an electric rhythmicality; every scene bounces as if dancing to the beat of its own drum.In the context of values, Black Panther serves as an intelligent if broad debate between revolutionary rhetoric and the responsibilities of leadership.In a nutshell, this is one superhero film that definitely punches above the normal crash-bang-wallop weight. The Marvel Cinematic Universe just got a whole lot more interesting.Black Panther doesn't just hit its marks. It leaves many many marks. Landmarks. So get in the queue now, people.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther, directed by Ryan Coogler, tells the story of the new King T'Challa of Wakanda who must learn to handle the responsibilities of this title. Chadwick Boseman reprises his role as the Black Panther and goes up against his nemesis Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan.Pros:
Coogler has already proven himself to be an excellent director after movies like Fruitvale Station and Creed (both starring Jordan), but he showcases his full talents in Black Panther when given a huge budget to work with. The movie looks beautiful with bright lush colors. The soundtrack and musical score are also very good. At its heart, the movie's message is very profound and relevant to real world politics.As expected, Boseman is awesome as T'Challa. His character goes through so much and his development throughout is handled perfectly. The best scenes of this movie are when he has to look within himself to find answers when the people he always trusted let him down. The cast in general has very good chemistry. T'Challa's relationship with his sister Shuri (Letiitia Wright) is very funny and it's easy to buy them as siblings. His relationship with his love Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) is even better. It would be criminal not to mention Danai Gurira and what she gives this movie from an action standpoint. Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger is without a doubt the best villain the MCU has presented so far. His motivations are so clear and his ideology directly challenges T'Challa's. He is physically and psychologically the perfect adversary for Black Panther. Cons:
The pacing of the movie is a bit odd. It moves pretty quickly until everything comes to a head at the very end. More time should have been spent in between to flesh out the side characters and let the emotions sink in. In addition, the action scenes are not among Marvel's best. The last battle between Panther and Killmonger in particular is pretty disappointing in all honesty. The CGI felt unfinished and they could have been cut together better. Overall, Black Panther is a triumph for the MCU and its societal connotations. This is, in my opinion, the best origin movie that Marvel has made because of its amazing hero, great cast of role characters, and truly menacing villain. Black Panther gets an A.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is the 18. movie in the MCU and I expected to see a great story after the events in Captain America: Civil War. I am a bit disappointed with the film now and I think that it is one of the worst in the MCU.Firstly, I didn't see the great badass Black Panther from the previous movie - he was powerful, confident and inspiring in Civil War. In this film he was totally different character and I had the feeling that Killmonger entirely deserved his moral victory. Erik was an interesting villain, one of the best in the MCU - Michael B. Jordan did a good job in this film. I would also like to praise Martin Freeman and Daniel Kaluuya for their performance (I give this 7/10 mostly because of these two phenomenal actors). Overall, Black Panther is OK, but it is far behind Thor: Ragnarok, Guardians of the Galaxy (1 and 2) and Iron Man (1) in the MCU.</review-text>

This has, rightfully so, created a &quot;buzz&quot; about the significance of this. It is a watershed moment for SuperHero films (much like last year's WONDER WOMAN was a watershed for a female led SuperHero film). But the question remains - is it a good film?The answer: Good Enough.Diving deeper into the character/hero T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) who was first introduced in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. In this film, we learn more about the backstory of this man/character as well as the world in which he lives and the burdens he bears. It also, interestingly enough, pretty much ignores the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for much of it's 2 hour 14 minute timeline. It mostly concerns itself with interior issues in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda and I think this tactic is a welcome relief from the giant, CGI-laden, characters-heavy Marvel films of recent memory.Director/Writer Ryan Coogler (CREED/FRUITVALE STATION) decides to focus the attention of this film inward, rather than outward and we are rewarded with a rich, Shakespearean family drama that works because of it's simplicity.Much of the effectiveness is due to the charismatic cast that has been drawn to this picture because of the significance of it as well as the richness of the characters they inhabit. Bozeman is regal and strong in the title role - no hint of the suffering, &quot;I don't want this&quot; SuperHero angst so often seen in these types of film. Academy Award winner Lupito Nyong'o joins in just as strong and independently as Nakia a &quot;Spy&quot; and erstwhile romantic foil for T'Challa - though Coogler is wise to avoid the &quot;will they/won't they&quot; cliche as well as eliminates, entirely, the &quot;damsel in distress&quot; subplot that would have been so tempting.Helping these two out are a veritable &quot;who's who&quot; of actors of color - Angela Bassett, Forrest Whitaker, current Best Actor nominee Daniel Kaluuya and Sterling K. Brown - all turn out for fun (albeit brief) turns where each one of them gets a chance to show what they can do. Special notice should be made to Danai Gurira (TV's kick-ass Michonne in THE WALKING DEAD) as Okoye - T'Challa's chief general and bodyguard who must choose duty over honor (or does she) and, especially, Letitia Wright as T'Challa's younger, wise-cracking sister - who also happens to be the &quot;Q&quot; of this film. She jumped off the screen and shone brightly (but not so bright as to wash things out) in every scene she was in.And...of course...there is Coogler favorite Michael B. Jordan (he's been in all of Coogler's major motion picture) as the villain of the piece - Erik Killmonger (the name says it all). Jordan does a nice job of bringing 3 dimensions to a character that was written a little too 2 dimension-ally, if you ask me. This character could have just been an &quot;angry young man&quot; cliche, but with Jordan, he becomes something much, much more.This being a Marvel SuperHero film, the Special Effects are terrific, showing a highly secretive, highly technolized Wakanda that is hidden beneath the surface.Is it a perfect film? Well...no. This is, in essence, a &quot;family drama&quot; with some hi-tech action scenes and the obligatory &quot;two armies fighting&quot; finale, and while the acting is good enough to hold interest throughout, I would have liked to have seen a little more action thrown in.But...ignoring the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was a good move - as was casting such strong, believable and likeable film actors.Letter Grade: A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)</review-text>

		<review-text>Okay to start things of.. pardon my grammar, i'm just a foreign dude who love movies and a big fan of marvel movies.. that's it.
im just here to swing by cause i got a lot of complaint with the movie and why i give it 7/10..
i admit that this movie is a good addition action flick to another marvel films that ever created until now, but i'm just expecting something more as a marvel fan, cause of the trailer that they always drop before the movie.
There are some weaknesses, such as a rather slow start, and some battle scenes that are somewhat forced timings .
there is a scene where t'challa is inaugurated as king and a black panther that should have an extraordinary scene but it looks rather dull and boring like nothing just happened.
nevertheless, the movie has some great moments and cool scenes even if it does not make an impression on my memory.
by the way, andy serkis gives a great performance here, he deserves more attention and I respect himIn conclusion, if you're a marvel lover, you might like this because infinity war is coming and everyone is waiting for it, and this movie is just a great addition to the other marvel action flick.
but if you're not a marvel fan, this movie has some decent action but not perfect..</review-text>
		<review-title>i'm expecting more from this one.. but its okay ,i guess</review-title>

		<review-text>Black PantherAn alluring and beguile world, fancy technology, mythically inherent rituals and a knack for projecting breathtaking action sequences are the high points of this feature that is not only supported but celebrated by the IMAX screen. Black Panther is raw non-volatile feature that begrudges and empowers the humanness in it despite of its &quot;superness&quot; but is confined within a territory that is loosely placed on over 134 minutes of runtime stretching its way to create something colossal out of just a mere idea. Ryan Coogler puts all his chips in to create this huge act and is convincing throughout the course of it but is somewhat restrained by the script that is familiar to the viewers. Chadwick Boseman tries a lot to overpower the other actors opposite him but there is something that just doesn't feel like &quot;king&quot; to us yet, whilst on the other hand he is supported by some of the finest talents like Michael B. Jordan and Lupita Nyong'o and other cameos that holds tightly onto their parts. Black Panther takes its time to settle in; especially its first act, and reaches for the bigger bite on its second act which is quite interesting as the plot thickens and politics gets in but all of that is barely around us before the last act arrives which is not only predictable but also seems a bit long.</review-text>

		<review-text>I don't know whether the critics for these movies are bought or afraid to be commenting this movie because of its political standpoint. The film DOES NOT living up to the critics point and user's rating. I would give 2/10 and 3/10 at best. The most entertaining part of this movie is Andy Serkis, and I think Andy Serkis is a more potential villian than this Killmonger portrayed by Michael B. Jordan.I expect for Black Panther to be acting as a wise, intellegent, strategist and also a martial art mastery more of like The Batman of Marvel Universe. This film does not show any of it. Overall it is just boring and I think this movie just needed to be there to fill the plothole of coming Avengers movie.Otherwise there are no entertaining scene or part (even the action is boring), I would not recommend you to watch it</review-text>

		<review-text>TL;DR
Stunning aestheticsCommitment to African culture and Afrofuturism is wonderful with terrific resultsA very colourful filmA refreshingly different feel for a superhero filmExciting, fast-paced and varied actionAs much comedy as you'd hope from a Marvel movieGreat performances with a strong supporting cast and one of Marvel's most compelling villainsBlack Panther is a special film in a number of ways. Not only is it the 18th Marvel film and the last one before the big third outing for the Avengers, but it's big for black culture and Afrofuturism, being the first big blockbuster superhero film featuring a black lead and, more importantly, a nearly all black cast (and crew). It's a step in the right direction for an increasingly out-dated and politically incorrect Hollywood, with arrogant 'white males' quivering in their seats. More than this, Black Panther is an incredible movie, more than a worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The aesthetics are inspiring, every inch of Wakanda utterly African, each scene evoking a strong and exemplary sense of Afrofuturism. Black Panther is absolutely committed to the African cultures it portrays and the effect is not only different, but visually stunning and incredibly colourful. More importantly, it never feels forced, gimmicky or frequently mentioned, constantly reminding people how PC they are. Instead the blend of African cultures embodied in Wakanda feels natural and organic and its detail is wonderful at every level.In fact the aesthetics throughout the whole film are gorgeous. CGI, as expected in a film of this calibre, is second-to-none, but the cinematography alongside really captures the beauty of Wakanda, the wonders of a fictional technologically-advanced African country brought to life. Wakanda, stunning as it is, also feels fresh; Black Panther isn't just another superhero film with the titular character fighting their way across New York City. This freshness stretches throughout the whole movie, making it seem like a new kind of superhero film and putting to rest any doubts that Marvel's films could become stale or repetitive.It is a Marvel film though so there are some aspects that we come to expect; some that are welcome and some that are happily missing in this movie. One is the comedy, which is abundant throughout Black Panther. With plenty of laughs from beginning to end - coming from M'Baku (Winston Duke) and Shuri in particular - it helps in allowing Black Panther to fit effortlessly into the broader personality of the MCU. Origin stories are also expected in superhero films, but here that is forgone, something that adds to its strength. It never gets bogged down in origins or unnecessary details explaining comic book lore; instead, like with Spider-Man: Homecoming, it just gets going and tells us what we need to know as it goes, letting exposition fit neatly into the film and never letting it slow down the pace. Superhero action too is worthy of praise as it is some of the best we've seen yet. With multiple films of this genre coming out every year, it's understandably becoming difficult to impress an audience. However Black Panther has a slightly more fresh approach to its action; not too deep-rooted in unrealistic sci-fi/fantasy, the action is fast-paced, fun to watch and brilliantly choreographed with varied action. This latter point is largely down to Black Panther being almost an ensemble film. While the focus of the story and a lot of the action is on T'Challa, he's not the sole interest of the film. Instead we often see him fighting alongside Nakia, Okoye and even sometimes Shuri. Each with different personalities as well as fighting styles, this lends a varied approach to the fight scenes and make them so much more interesting to watch. Yet the highlight is still the titular Black Panther, with expert martial arts and gymnastics blending together to be an absolute joy.The joy doesn't stop with the action though. The quiet times are sometimes just as much fun, with the cast clearly having a blast. Chadwick Boseman builds on his debut in Captain America: Civil War, still retaining the characterisation from that film, but expanding it and making us love this character even more. Wise, strong and determined, he makes a fine King for Wadanda; but funny, sweet and loyal, he makes a fine superhero for the MCU. Boseman excels at bringing out all sides of T'Challa and we can't wait to see more of him in later this year with the rest of the MCU by his side. By his side this time though are a fine group of characters who could maybe even give the Avengers a run for their money. Okoye has a harsh-edge to her and watching her fight is incredible, yet Danai Gurira gives us a soft edge that she only reveals occasionally, making her enigmatic character more appealing. Letitia Wright and Lupita Nyong'o too bring so much personality to the film, often stealing scenes from the titular hero himself. Michael B. Jordan makes a worthy antagonist, actually being one of Marvel's best villains yet. Since their history of villains hasn't been great to date, you could assume that that isn't too high an accolade, but despite that he is a sympathetic villain with a likeable, funny side - the sort of villainy that made us all love Loki - supported by fellow bad guy, Andy Serkis returning as Klaue. Though not appearing much, he certainly makes his mark and lives up to the character's reputation. Martin Freeman's return as Ross is also very welcome and never a gimmicky, unnecessary reference to the wider MCU; instead he is allowed to develop a part that was too small in Civil War. This time he fits in organically and his American accent is as impressive as Andy Serkis' South African.It's safe to say that all the hype for Black Panther was worth it because it really is everything we wanted it to be. With exciting and varied non-stop action, plenty of comedy and an excellent ensemble of characters it fits into the rest of the Marvel cannon seamlessly. And while this one forgoes the sometimes unnecessary origin story, dives into a great plot and actually gives us an enjoyable villain, the best thing that stands out about Black Panther is how fresh it feels and looks and how committed it is to the inclusion of African culture and inclusivity. Yet again Marvel have delivered another outstanding film that instantly soars towards the top of the list.</review-text>

		<review-text>This movie is great actually but it has flaws and definitely isn't the best movie in the MCU. So Pros and cons.
Pros
The acting was superb, every actor in the cast did a fantastic job eBay Michael B Jordan steals the show. I used to think he was just ok but he was excellent in this.-The fight scenes were great. On Par with Civil War but not as good as TWS.
Killmonger was a good villian, if they had have made his goal less 'take over the world' he would've been amazing but I understand iphis motivation. We see that he feels betrayed that he could have been raised by royalty but instead lived in poverty eventually becoming orphaned.The comedic timing was good, it didn't feel out of place like a lot of other Marvel movies.Cons
The third act was so underwhelming and unsatisfying it hurt. Everything is rapped up too neatly and the final fight didn't reflect anything learnt throughout the movie, just that T'Challa is more perceptive? Strategic? Idk.T'Challa had no arc. He started at one political view at the start of the movie and just changed it. I didn't have much investment in T'Challa.No one cared about Zuri. We should have.CGI looked like stretch Armstrong at some points.</review-text>

		<review-text>One seriously don't go into this film think its a racially motivated film, if you're looking for this to fuel some anger and use it as a political standpoint to fuel a race war then you need to check your moral campus, because this film is completely opposite on political views which address a lot of the world issue not just in Wakanda, some of which that were mention in this film I agree with.But I'm not gonna spend the whole of this review explaining the political side of this film, although most of these motive from T'Challa played brilliantly by Chadwick Boseman show a man seeing the past mistake of his ancestors and wanting to make the world a better place through help each other and become as one tribe there for each other. But know that its ok to help each other but the world has its issue that it must overcome in order to bring peace and help each other, me person not even reading or know anything about the comic books of black panther, watching this film I understood his motives and passion, not just for his own people but to help the world as well.If you never read any of the comic books this film does do a great job in giving black panther a backstory while helping you understand his character and motivate. I personally love the lion king style reference which was a nice touching moment for this film with the animal spirit guides.although the film doesn't really represent Wakanda as Wakanda is a fictional place based on the nation in Africa like Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, and the Congo more like an amalgamation of these real African nations, economies, and cultures.Which is represented in trial by combat for leadership and the woman shown as strong African warriors kind of like the amazons which is shown perfectly in the film with Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira playing these role along with ladies playing warriors There is also a few moment where we get some funny moment which does overdo it like most other Marvel films have done in the past.Even the whole casting is pretty good in this film along with its acting but it does suffer a lot of problems, not that this is a bad film, there are a few things that make this a pretty average film and not a perfect one. By far out of all the Marvel villains Micheal B Jordan is best so far in having a true motive to be evil but with one flaw in his story playing Erik Killmonger. With the mention of this black panther being the James bond of the comic book universe I would say total true on that part with Letitia Wright play a technology expert like Q from Bond films, so in a way, that reference is true which actually works.Although this of what I said is all the good parts of the film, there is a lot of issues the film has which will be addressed in dislikes. Dislikes : Few problems with the film one being the main villain, which is a shame since Michael b Jordan playing this role is the best villain they have done by far, the problem here is that he doesn't get enough screen time as the film focus too much on the political and tribal side of the film.Which is ok which puts more focus on world issue and the conflict with T'Challa having to be a king while protecting the world around him, but as the main villain of the film there should've been more focus there as well because it seem that michael b Jordan character was only relevant in the 3rd act, he only become the golden jaguar for the last 30mins of the film.  This is what I mean by the film being unbalanced too much focused on the political side which drag the film down slightly.The other issue is some of the camera work it like the camera person can keep the camera still for 5 mins, there were a least 20mins of the film that was slight shaking, the some of the action scene again with this shaky camera. This show complete amateur filmmaking when a director has to rely on shaky camera effects for action screen, it the most hated thing in a film every, i urge film make to stop using it.</review-text>

		<review-text>This film is amazing watched in imax 3d. I watch most comic book movies this way for the last ten years,black panther is on another level for a standalone film the action affects story pacing brilliant never bored once. I wanted to watch it straight away again the only better marvel movie is the original avengers and logan but that isn't really marvel. Trust me don't listen to all the haters and watch this film I'm going to watch it again and I haven't done that with a film since the matrix enough said long live the KING.</review-text>

		<review-text>The movie itself is fine, well-made, but nothing out of the ordinary. Marvel fans will love this one, since Black Panther is a well-developed character. Plus, the villain got more personal screen time, so for me it's one of the best villain of the MCU made thus far.The overload of jokes was toned down for this movie, which i think its a really good for two reasons: It fits the moral of the story, and previous marvel movies were full-on comedies, with not so great humor. So Marvel fan will have a blast, and im sure this movie will pick a large audience, not only Marvel Fans. It's a great action flick, with a great soundtrack too ! It's just not different from what you have already seen. It's good, go see it if you are interested, otherwise I don't think you will enjoy it, and will be rather disapointed with all the good reviews its getting (87/100 on metacritic). I enjoyed it more than previous and recent Marvel movies, but I dont think it's the best marvel movie at all (like the praise its getting).</review-text>

		<review-text>I'm really growing to dislike superhero films. There have only been a few that've come out in the past couple years and I've enjoyed. The rest all seem to follow the same tried and tested formula, and do nothing original. The same copypasted laziness I've come to expect from every marvel film popped up in this one:Bad Villain: The main villain (killmonger) is both poorly written and, for the most part, poorly acted. Michael B. Jordan did a good job of convincing me he was a violent war vet with a troubled past, and not much else. He did a terrible job of looking and sounding genuinely angry. When you confront the man who you perceive as responsible for mass suffering and, in some ways, the death of your father, you scream at them and look angry, you don't just talk to them in a stern voice like they're a chihuahua that just peed on the rug, and have a face like you just noticed someone farted. The one thing I will give him credit for is he was still a better villain than other ones I've seen from marvel, purely because they didn't shoehorn in character-breaking comedic relief for once.Contrived Conflict: Marvel doesn't seem to know how to create interesting moral dilemmas, and it would have been easy to do so in black panther. An example of a challenging conflict in a superhero film is in Watchmen; the costs and benefits for each side are not clear-cut, each alternative has high stakes, and best of all, NOT ALL VIEWERS AGREE ON WHICH SIDE IS RIGHT. It makes the viewer question their moral fiber, and makes for a very interesting ending. Black Panther's conflict is ridiculous, but it didn't have to be. If they didn't write killmonger as a bloodthirsty vet hell-bent on using Wakanda's powers to conquer the world and commit genocide, but instead a jaded soldier who wanted to end Wakanda's isolationist policy and share their technology for the greater good of humanity, despite harm possibly befalling Wakanda and the world gaining further power to destroy itself, wouldn't that have been far more interesting? It's an intriguing moral conflict, and it's so plainly apparent this would have made for a better conflict than cut-and-dried lawful good vs chaotic evil.No plot twists: None. As usual, the conflict is resolved by running around and punching each other. Granted, you need that stuff in a superhero film, but there is no excuse for the lack of a plot twist. Everyone likes a good plot twist, and it provides better entertainment value when the protag uses something unexpected to defeat the antag. The film is for the most part devoid of plot twists, and that just makes it a linear, boring story.I wish I had more good things to say about this film, but I don't, besides that I liked the look of the wakandan technology, the scenes on the ancestral plains, and the scenery is absolutely gorgeous. The scenes set in Wakanda look great, if you don't focus too hard on the bad CGI animals.The final thing I'd like to bring up is, I'm reviewing this as someone who enjoys a good film, not a comic book fan, because I've never read a superhero comic in my life. Why am I saying this? Well, I didn't even know the black panther was a thing until this film came out, so all I know about him is from the film. And I know absolutely nothing about him. Sure, I know about the complete history of Wakanda now, and how the suit works, but T'Challa is even less developed than the main villain, maybe even his own father, who's only in the film for all of 20 minutes at most. This film could've been called &quot;Wakanda&quot; and no one would have batted an eyelid. T'Challa takes a backseat to the story for the most part, and is possibly the least developed main protag I've ever seen in a superhero film.It has a beginning, middle, end, and it looks good. If you like all marvel films, you'll like this. If you're expecting something better than the average marvel film, you're out of luck on this one.</review-text>

		<review-text>I feel sorry for those who have watched this film and gave it poor ratings because the actors don't act like your average marvel &quot;American actors&quot;. I've grown up around Nigerians and Kenyans and I can tell you for sure the acting was spot on. They captured their culture and mannerisms in a respectable manner. 
I've seen most of the marvel movies and was growing bored until this movie. It actually has a message in it that's not to be missed. I've never experienced that within marvel movies. It usually features the same plot and the same cheesy &quot;good overcomes evil&quot; message. But the message portrayed in this movie is one that highlights current issues and should truly be taken to heart.
On another note, I feel so proud of the lighting, makeup and wardrobe used to highlight the beauty of black people. I often feel the lighting on black people within movies and TV still in this day and age makes them look washed out and grey. This movie truly makes their colour shine like pure gold! It was beautiful just to watch this even without the plot. 
My hope is that the character of Black Panther can bring depth into the Avengers movies and take the plot to a whole new level.</review-text>

		<review-text>I have to say, after all the hoopla (which I was growing tired of), Black Panther ranks for me as one of the best action movies of all time, 2nd only to Return of the Jedi (don't judge me), and even one of the best dramas. Was surprised by so much of this sort of &quot;anti-hype&quot; criticism. I believe some used to the typical super hero flick of Today, simply want pulse-pounding action every minute, with a few wise-cracks thrown in, and maybe half-decent lines delivered. This is different, and that old formula is so tired and played at this point in the MCU. This story, the special effects, the intrigue, and the action were all superb. However, what was truly phenomenal was the acting by such a massive cast. This just doesn't happen in action, let alone super hero flicks, even today. Those who refuse to see it for the racial reason or know people like that. Tell them it really is just that good beyond the racial make-up, then tell them a White hero actually figures prominently in the end, so don't fret... ;-)</review-text>

		<review-text>First of all, I'm glad that great ratings are continuing to climb on this film despite the phony low reviews that have been given here. My experience after watching it twice and also planning watching a third time, believe the hype.Ryan Coogler does an excellent job and the actors are incredible. He knows who his strong actors are and they deliver 110%. He made Michael B. Jordan's role as Killmonger so complex that you didn't know whether to dislike him or be on his side despite how menacing he was. I cannot wait to see him in Creed 2 so I can be reminded it that he really is a good person lol!This movie doesn't really show heavy action for Black Panther (you get that intro in Civil War) but it introduces you more to how he operates as the new king, and the choices he will have to make. However, leaves you satisfied just the same.Ludwig Gorranson who does an excellent job with the music score, is no stranger when it comes to working with Ryan, as he has worked with him in Fruitvale Station and Creed. The music score is a character within itself, as they literally speak for Black Panther/T'Challa and Killmonger during their quiet moments. The research and tours with these excellent musicians during his visits to so many countries in Africa really showed, and I understand why Coogler likes working with him.I do hope people do not fall for these bad reviews which are obviously there to try to scare people away. My parents are not even into comics and they enjoyed every second. For a lengthy movie, it didn't even feel like you were there that long. Go see the movie for yourselves. Everyone isn't lying when you hear the majority saying something is that great.</review-text>

		<review-text>Look, I came to this movie with excitment, and with an open mind. I didn't even watch the trailer for the movie, the movie got so much hype and good reviews from pplaces like Rotten Tomatoes at 98% making it the highest scoring superhero movie and Imdb with a 7.8 rating. People were saying best superhero movie ever, Michael B Jordans villain was the best villian in movie history, the villian was better than Heath Ledgers Joker, did you read that, b-e-t-t-e-r than Heath Ledgers Joker, okay now you've crossed the line. Michael B Jordans preformance as the villian was good, but in no way does it stand next to The Joker.Plot: The plot for this movie was set up in a good way, it reminded me of The Lion King, which I think was better than Black Panther. Except it got boring, I never have nearly fell asleep in a movie, even in the action scenes. It got pretty boring and really, really futeristic. It got boring because of a lot of talking but I didn't really care about characters dying, Sometimes I didn't even get the big deal about someone dying. Actors: I have to give props to the actors in the movie, most of all Andy Serkis, who is usually a monkey actor for Planet Of The Apes, and King Kong. I am glad Andy got a chance to show his other acting skills to the world even though he is already a brilliant actor and very underrated. Overall Michael B Jordan, Chadwick Boseman and the lady supporting actors like Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira were really good as well.Editing and CGI: There was a lot of CGI in this movie for obvious reasons and mostly because the movie is so futeristic with extreme technology and flying things and things like that. Other places included scenery and landscapes like waterfalls and other nature were very good and they nailed that.Feedback: To be raw this isn't the superhero movie I was looking for. This wasn't anything like Spiderman Homecoming or other Marvel movies, which it doesn't have to be exactly like other movies it's just they coulld have made this movie a lot more intriguing and interesting. The hype really wasn't needed for this movie but it was mostly the African American people really excited about a new Black superhero, which I understand because if they made a movie surrounding my country people will get really excited to because pretty much all movies are based in America because America always gets the spotlight. But It was great to finally have a Black superhero for a change instead of having a predominatly white American superheros, and It's great that they are spreading superheros to other areas around the globe and I hope they continue to do that for places like Europe, Australia and other places around the world. But saying the movie is a really good film because it is a Black Superhero isn't the way to judge how good a movie is. This movie got boring for me and that is just my opinion but it seems a lot of other people agree as well. It was over hyped, huge budget, but really boring and nearly put me to sleep. I give Black Panther a 5.5/10, The best part was Andy Serkis's character.</review-text>

		<review-text>So so disappointed. Black Panther is one of my favorite comic book characters, and I have been looking forward to this from the moment he appeared in civil war. But I was actually bored for the first time in a marvel film, his story and part in civil war was so much better than his own film.This was superhero movie by the numbers....... our man suffers a tragedy to make him suit up, baddie turns up and beats him up a bit, then he returns from the 'dead' to win the day...... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzOh and dont bother hanging on for the after trailer clips......Lets hope infinity war makes up for this.....</review-text>

		<review-text>Throughout most of Black Panther, the central political antagonism is one between non-violent nativist isolationism (represented by T'Challa and his ruling-class cohort) and pan-African anti-colonial revolutionary struggle (represented by N'Jadaka/Erik Stevens).The problem with this antagonism is that N'Jadaka, the radical revolutionary and the primary antagonist, is also portrayed as a warmongering maniac (fueled by childhood trauma and motivated by vengeance) who wants to rule over the world. This is precisely what radical anti-colonial thinkers like Frantz Fanon have warned against - the biggest danger of anti-colonial struggle is establishing a new oppressive regime in the place of the old one. In the film, N'Jadaka is trying to do precisely that - to play the colonizer's game against themselves and replace white hegemony with black hegemony. In this respect, the film, being a thoroughly ideological product, eagerly conflates radical struggle with totalitarian ambitions. Although it tries to make the audience sympathize with N'Jadaka's motivations, its ideological message is clear enough - political radicalism is a psychological pathology that must be defeated.Towards the end, T'Challa changed his mind and no longer believes in a nativist approach to an increasingly interconnected &quot;multicultural&quot; (read: global capitalist) world. So what does the film end on? A reformist and assimilationist politics combined with a bland and complacent liberal humanism. Let's build social outreach centers in black neighborhoods without challenging the political and economic mechanisms that make structural inequality and mass incarceration possible. Let's share our resources with the world, sing Kumbaya at the UN and forget about the systematic exploitation of Third World workers and the endless imperialist wars fought in service of global finance capital. Let's uphold bourgeois peace and defeat those &quot;crazy&quot; radicals. Let's ignore the institutions and the people who are actually responsible for large-scale human suffering and just hold everyone's hands and celebrate our &quot;shared humanity&quot;. Is it surprising that all this ideological garbage is coming out of a mainstream Hollywood superhero film? Not at all.For all the &quot;smart&quot; political commentaries and metaphors, Black Panther is ultimately steeped in the same hegemonic logic that it pretends to challenge. Black liberation is and has always been about struggling against deeply oppressive colonial and imperialist regimes. All this history of antagonism is conveniently erased in favor of a comfortable, feel-good bourgeois humanism.</review-text>

		<review-text>First, it's important to remember that this, like all comic book to screen films, is derived from material that is made to appeal to the intellect of a 14 year old so the plot lines will not help anyone's quest to understanding the meaning of life (its just a movie folks!). The historically significant and ground breaking fact that it has a (nearly) all black cast and the impact that will have on the audiences, Hollywood producers and the earning potential of non-white actors going forward is noteworthy. Basically, it is a well crafted film with generous amounts of humor and suspense sprinkled throughout and, peeking at some of the reviews here before seeing it for myself, I expected less but got much more. Its an entertaining two hour amusement park ride that I enjoyed very much.</review-text>

		<review-text>I am from Portugal and finally i was able to see the movie.I need to write this little review, because i noticed that many users are making fake´s reviews and it´s noticeable that they didn´t saw the movie (see the news about the facebook group that wants to sabotage this movie).Contrary to most people that talked about the action being great (because they thought they could use that to throw people off), the action wasn't as great. Some Shoots were too dark and some scenes had some annoying jump cuts, so overall it was decent to good, and maybe one great action scene. The pacing of the movie was odd at certain times, but nothing that can damage the movie.Very solid acting all over the place, even from minor supporting cast. They were able to introduce some comedy through the personality of some characters organically, and sometimes the females characters took the movie and had great spotlight's, making the main character look like a secondary character.The Villain...oh my, take Loki away, this is the best villain that MCU has right now (for me, even better than Loki). That is very apparent when you can understand and agree at some extent with is point of view. Even when you know his plans will bring chaos to the world, maybe because of his charisma, you want him to win at some extent.Great shoots of Wakanda and great world building.Great Story, with political views, they even manage to give appropriate screen time to all the characters, with essential dialogues and action.I will give it a 8.0/10.It´s definitly a very good comic movie, but i need to see it again, to make a final judgement. Right now, is not better then The Avengers, CA: WS or CA: CW (this 3 are on another level), but i think that from the 18 MCU movies, maybe he deservers the #6 or #7 spot.</review-text>

		<review-text>Was so refreshing and beautiful to see black men and women in positions of power fighting for what they believe in. Much more accurate reflection of the real world than other Marvel movies. Characters are so well-written and three-dimensional. I was on everyone's side at different points. I've never seen a superhero movie like this where the protagonist and the antagonist were both equally right and wrong. The plot and message are so powerful. Some amazing lines that I can't believe are in a Marvel movie. Cinematography is breathtaking. Wakanda is excellent both visually and thematically!! Definitely the best Marvel movie, one of the best movies I've ever seen period.</review-text>

		<review-text>Like many others, i have waited for months for Black Panther to come out. Although i was incredibly excited, a little part of was worried that the movie wouldn't live up to the expectations placed upon it. BUT boy, did it blow my mind. It ended up surpassing my expectation by miles (and i was expecting a lot). It was truly an exquisite film. Chad Boswick acting as the Black Panther was perfection...not one thing was forced, everything he did, he did with grace and ease. Danai Gurira as Okoye was beyond words; she was fierce, elegant and a total badass. Lupita Nypngo, Letita Wright, Micheal B Jordan, Martin Freeman etc..were incredibly stunning as well. The heartfelt acting shined through every actor and actress. The visuals were glorious, the portrayal of African culture in all its beautiful halo was something of a sight to behold. And i can go on forever talking about the beautiful African costumes worn by almost everyone in the movie. This is a film that is educational, honest, visually stunning, humbling and historical. It does not bullshit or gloss up anything. No matter what others say, DO yourself a favor and go watch it. You will love seeing people at the theater dressed in their finest, happy and proud as hell. Shyt, i was.</review-text>

		<review-text>Let me start by saying I had high expectations about this film based on the trailer and all that was riding on this new addition to MCU. A fan of the Black Panther comic as a kid, I was really looking forward to this movie, and excited to see it!The graphics were incredible! The costumes and choreography during the fight scenes were great! Some of the actors were better than others, but overall, the acting was pretty good. Props and scenery were amazing!So, what's missing? Frankly, the story line, which lacks substance (except for a few socio-political lines), feels a bit rushed, repetitive, and bland. ****SPOILER WARNING****Namely, Black Panther is crowned King and goes through a spiritual ritual to take on the mantle. He then learns he has a cousin. Cousin shows up and wants the throne. They battle it out and cousin wins. Cousin goes through the same spiritual ritual to become king. Meanwhile, Black Panther, is assumed dead. His girlfriend steels a magic herb before they are all burned by King Cousin. Later, girlfriend, sister, and Panther's mother discover he is not dead but in a coma and being cared for by a rival tribe. Mother gives him herb as he goes through the spiritual ritual a second time. He comes out of the coma, takes on King Cousin, and wins back the throne.It's like take, rinse, repeat. Although the movie is over two hours long, it seems like they rushed to get it all in, yet it still lacks substance. One reviewer said the humor was ill-placed, and I would agree. In the middle of a serious moment, quick one-liners were intended to be funny, but for the most part only deserved a slight chuckle, clearly lacking Thor's most recent comic-ridden outing.Plus, the movie focuses a lot on the female warriors, who are supposed to be supporting characters. Instead, they often overshadow the Black Panther, making him look weak and unimportant. Don't get me wrong, I like the female army. They kick butt! However, they often appear stronger than the main character and he gets lost in the background at times.I can overlook most of it because every movie has its flaws. And had the story line been better, this movie would most likely have been 2018's big breakout! Monetarily, I'm sure it will do well. But I have a feeling it will be a one-time-only movie without repeat viewers spending their hard-earned money to get a second look before it goes to Redbox.</review-text>

		<review-text>That is the only thing that could come out of this film. It is not terrible like the new 'Star Wars' but it could have been much better. I am not into gender wars (Wonder Woman) and now race wars, but I have to say this film is just over-hyped and all about gadgets and technology. That in itself was disappointing because the setting is hard to believe and swallow.This film also contributes to it, but is not at fault in and of itself, but I am growing tired of the constant barrage of Marvel characters Disney is releasing every week. Again, better than Star Wars and whatever has Scarlet Johansson squatting and doing flip flops in, but as a whole the character development is not there and so the character is swamped by technology.Valerian last year was a much better film and because it didn't have Disney's hype machine behind did so poorly. Shows you race baiting and hype is winning.</review-text>

		<review-text>I read Black Panther comics in the 70's and was looking forward to this movie since it's announcement. I must say I was pleasantly surprised by Ryan Coogler's 3rd directorial installment in a visually stunning and character driven superhero movie. Killmonger was just as nuanced as &quot;Homecoming's&quot; The Vulture which was refreshing as the comic book version was one dimensional. I loved the supporting characters namely Shuri, Nakia, Okoya and especially Mbaku.
My critiques were that the first half was a bit slow and the CGI was poor in certain spots. Given the fact that disgruntled critics driven from Rotten tomatoes have apparently found their way to IMDB ( no reason for 1 star reviews) I've added an extra star.</review-text>

		<review-text>Now, I'm just gonna lay it out there even though it's an unpopular review but I found the movie, uhm, just good. I have gone online and read multiple reviews about how it's one of the best of the 18 MCU movies to date and for me, it's not even in my Top 5. I've been trying to figure out why it didn't do it for me, and I'm not sure maybe it's because it comes right after Thor Ragnarok (best MCU movie so far), or it comes before Infinity War (we've all seen the trailer, like give it to us already!) I feel the first 30 minutes or so was a drag, albeit the cinematography and costumes were astounding (google the Filipino influence on the female warriors' costume), but was necessary in order to setup the movie but I didn't get reeled in until maybe Laetitia Wright as Shuri, the black princess (Disney's 2nd, progress!) that can give Tony Stark a run for his money (literally and figuratively) showed up and somewhat stole the show. Danai Gurira imposed herself very well as Okoye, Black Panther's General and leader of the fierce all-female badass army Dora Milaje. Lupita Nyong'o held her own as the requisite &quot;damsel in distress&quot;, Daniel Kaluuya as BP's right hand man (hated him but still love him) and last but not the least, Michael B. Jordan who I'm thankful they rescued from the dreaded Fantastic Four reboot as one of the movie's antagonist. You know who I'm not raving about? Chadwick Boseman. He seemed okay in Civil War and I don't know if he had to stay stiff because he was royalty but he was boring as a brick. As in don-the-suit-already-and-scratch-my-eye kind of boring. I was actually thinking Chiwetel Ejiofor would've been a better choice but he's already come up as Mordo in Dr. Strange. Storyline was interesting and current, fight scenes were worth the wait, the ending could've been better but is good enough.So to recap, good movie, great visuals, impressive supporting cast, exhilarating fight scenes and we want a Shuri, Tony Stark face off.Favorite quote: We must find a way to look after each other, as if we were one single tribe.</review-text>

		<review-text>Don't compare it to an Avengers/Civil War movie, there isn't more heroes than the Black Panther. And it's great first movie, they explain a lot and we get to know Wakanda and its people.
Don't know why some people react negatively on the villain because he was great, he was someone who lost his father att a young age and thrived only to have revenge(psycho).

		<review-text>It was hard for there to be stakes in Black Panther because the Avengers Infinity War trailer exists. As a viewer you know that the film will ultimately end with T'Challa alive and the country of Wikanda in a good situation because that's exactly what the Infinity War trailer shows. The film does offer good and enthusiastic performances from its cast most notably for me Andy Serkis' Klaue and also showcases the interesting culture of Wikanda but it does suffer from formulaic Marvel trends such as reluctance to kill off major characters and weak villians. While the film does focus on the themes of international relations between countries and racism its attempts to get the audience to think about these matters feel forced and sometimes juxaposes the films sometimes humourous tone. Overall, I feel that the film offers strong special effects, performances and it has interesting story elements but ultimately it fails create any tension or invest its audience during its 2hr 14 minute run time.</review-text>
		<review-title>Another Basic Marvel film...</review-title>
	</review>
	<review id="205">
		<review-text>Remove the social/political context within the film and it still shines through as an extremely well acted beautiful film from the costumes to the cinematography. Add the necessary social/political context and it becomes a film much needed for many reasons. Easily one of the best Marvel films I've seen and possibly sits at the top for above mentioned reasons. Weakest parts of the film were a couple of minor CGI action sequences and the unnecessary Martin Freeman character. Strongest parts was the rest of the action throughout, a fantastic cast who acted their roles perfectly and the solid storytelling. An excellent film from the combination of directing, writing, acting and special effects.</review-text>

		<review-text>This review of Black Panther is spoiler free**** (4/5)WITH ONLY A few films to his name director Ryan Coogler has taken a real turn in the world of cinema, first was tough-bearing directorial debut Fruitvale Station which was only a small indie project but after that it didn't take long for his name to be on the map, it was, inevitably a few years later when he made his second feature Creed (Rocky 7) where the illigitimate son of the late Apollo Creed would take his turn in the boxing world, and finally his third and latest film Black Panther is his chance at a big budget feature. However not only black power a main symbol in his features there's only one actor who has collaborated with the director in every one of his films; Michael B. Jordan. 
 
Black Panther opens not long after the death of his father King T'Chalka, which would then conjure up his revenge in Captain America: Civil War. Here he has swapped from being a supporting player to being the main feature, he's just about to be crowned King of Wakanda, the fictional African nation which has made an occasional entry in other MCU movies. For the ceremony he has to take on a challenger in gladiator-style combat, there's African-drum music in the air and the Wakandan natives are chanting to the beat. This is an important scene, one that changes the world of cinema in an excellent way, granted on occasion there have been a few films that make a few homages to a homely place, for example 2009's Avatar had the main character going to meet other tribes and there would be different design's to their clothing. Coogler follows that same insight. Like Taika Waititi before him who paid energetic homage to his home of New Zealand by adding his Antipodean style humour in Thor: Ragnarok, here Coogler is the polar opposite, he swaps the humour for the colour of the country and their natives who dress in African-style colours from bright reds, through yellows to the bright greens, even through the Africani accessories. Coogler's attention to the detail is exquisite. With that in mind, it's also an important film one that shows how much 21st century has changed and you could argue that it's for the better. After becoming king, T'challa (Chadwick Boseman) has to face his biggest challenge, to protect his country against the invasion of a former soldier with a mysterious past Jordan's Erik Killmonger (which sounds like a gaming profile), who wants to overthrow the king. So that's your average Marvel movie storytelling right there. However, Coogler doesn't make it the average Marvel film apart from his exquisite hand in the Africani detail, it's perhaps the most visually stunning comic-book movie, and the Panther's suit changing colour, the sand-like holograms and the amazing cityscape which shines thanks to Rachel Morrison's gorgeous cinematography. 
 
There's so much good in Black Panther, excellent action, stunning visuals, gorgeous cinematography and a director who pays an energetic homage to Africa, but the real standing point here is the female characters, from Danai Gurira, through Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o to T'challa's mother played by Angela Bassett. Who all put in excellent performances along with another standout performance by recent award's darling Daniel Kaluuya. Boseman and Jordan are excellent too, but here they're made into supporting players by these brilliant performers. In short, Coogler's go at the MCU and his third feature is a brilliant entry to his growing filmography one that takes an important scratch in cinema.
 
VERDICT Like Waititi before him Coogler pays energetic homage to his past life in the MCU's latest super extravaganza.</review-text>

		<review-text>Just came back from the cinema watching black panther in the UK. I have to say, the film was absolutely fantastic! Loved it! I go to Vue/ Odeon cinema in Manchester to watch pretty much all the films that come out and not once have I seen the cinema room so packed before :scream: It's pretty obvious that Black Panther is heavily influenced by the African culture, from the language to the clothing and so on. The message behind the film was well written! Man, after walking out of that cinema I have never felt more pound to be an African! I am defiantly going for a re-watch! Worth the cash!Although I have to agree with some of the reviews, the storyline was a little predictable and generic. However, other than that the acting in the film was phenomenal! You can obviously tell that each actor has put so much effort in their performance. I say if your a little curious on the film, definitely go and watch. Gather your own opinions on it, as the film itself does offer a lot.</review-text>

		<review-text>Never read a Black Panther comic? No need to worry! This movie covers all the bases on how every Black Panther (passed down from generation to generation) acquires their powers and the throne. Chadwick Boseman does an incredible job at playing the hero who struggles with leading an entire nation differently than his father did. The whole cast of colorful and skilled characters really make the story pop as there are elements of love, loss, drama, action, and comedy all throughout the film. You'll adore how it connects to previous MCU movies and Stan Lee's small cameo once again entertains! The villain has his reasons for being bad which we come to understand as an audience and his softer sides round out the ending quite nicely. See for yourself! Everyone brought their A-game in Black Panther and the visuals are so flipping cool!</review-text>

		<review-text>I thought it had a decent story and stunning visuals, the African elements were refreshing and creative. However, the political message is too glaring and forced, like a product placement. Also, coming from a country composed mainly of immigrants, the &quot;greatness only achieved via isolationism&quot; theme and the majority of media's praise of the movie as significant specifically because it is &quot;(representation) for blacks, and (directed, delivered) by blacks&quot; are turn offs. For that a 3 might still be too high. Somebody treated me to this movie, left on my own I'd never have spent the money.</review-text>

		<review-text>I went into this movie not having seen the trailers and not expecting much, which I find generally is the best way to fully enjoy a movie, sadly this movie delivered on my expectations.
A pretty generic storyline, stretched to over 2 hours and missing any real depth. I thought Ant-Man was quite weak for a Marvel movie, but its humour saved it, this one however was ever weaker and just not funny at all. If this is the standard of MCU movies to come, I think they best just give up now.
It isn't terrible, but if people keep praising things that aren't good, all because they believe it stands for something else, then we will keep getting sub-standard productions.
So let's be honest, this movie is average at best, even my 6 rating is probably a tad too high.</review-text>

		<review-text>I was super excited for this movie. Considering it is the last movie before the Avengers: Infinity War movie, I had high expectations for it.The story was all over the place. There was little presence of character development. The movie jumped into each of the characters as if we had already seen them all before in prequels.Klaw, played by Andy Serkis, was back. He was briefly introduced to us in Avengers: Age of Ultron. Klaw was selling stolen vibranium to Ultron in the middle of the movie. It was established that he was the only survivor to ever break into Wakanda and steal their precious vibranium metal. Now the Black Panther movie started in 1992, where it showed the aftermath of someone who betrayed Wakanda by giving Klaw a way to get in to steal the vibranium. It was actually an extremely weak opening to the movie. Instead of showing Klaw breaking into Wakanda and stealing the vibranium, it only showed a 5-10 second video surveillance clip of the destruction. This opening scene set for a terrible movie. Marvel should have shown Klaw breaking into Wakanda to give us more development for his character.The movie did not get interesting until towards the middle where the sale was going to be made for stolen vibranium. General Okoye, played by Danai Gurira, was absolutely awesome! She was by far the best character in the movie. Her dedication to the Wakanda throne was unparalleled. Okoye went crazy, in a good entertaining way, during the sale of the vibranium. I swear, I think she was fighting and beating up more people in this movie than Black Panther was!Black Panther, played by Chadwick Boseman, was disappointing. I am not referring to his performance. I am speaking of his character development. We were first introduced to him in Captain America: Civil War. We received a glimpse of him as Black Panther and Prince T'Challa. In this movie, it continued directly after the Captain America: Civil War movie timeline. It did not show T'Challa as a child. It did not show him learning how to become the Black Panther. It did not show any of that. Come on Marvel, what were you thinking?Black Panther's fighting scenes were annoying as well. The majority of his presence was at night. It made it difficult to see the detail of his ability and movement. There was really only one scene towards the end where his suit was not so blended in the dark, but it was quickly ended after the fight moved underground to the vibranium mining area.Erik Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan, was a great villain. But once again, there was minimal character development. It showed him as a child for a few seconds, then it fast forwarded to the present day. All of the in-between were quickly talked about and forgotten.Overall, I was not too pleased with this movie. Marvel could have done better with the opening scene and the character development. Now I am left questioning how good Avengers: Infinity War will be in May.</review-text>

		<review-text>Given the hype that surrounds this movie I wasn't surprised to see it's just a mediocre flic at best.
What's more shocking is the no bad review crusade, really? I'm glad I live in a country in which I'm not afraid to voice my opinion, be it bad or good.
This movies is loaded to the brim with every trope of the genre, up to the point it feels ridiculous.
If the movie would have steered away from this leftist and PC insanity, and tried to stay faithfull to the source material it would have made a good movie.
But what it does is that it tries to be all things and all people, while pleasing none.

		<review-text>In the same but different way, Black Panther is bringing on the same amount of significance that Wonder Woman did last year. Of course, it's crazy to think we're even at this point in 2018 where Black Panther (not the first overall) but the first mainstream superhero movie to have a black lead in years and the first one in the now 18 film long Marvel Cinematic Universe.To just say this film is important is an understatement. Diverse representation in films is among the most talked about things in the world of filmmaking these days and Black Panther makes another big step for the industry, especially looking at the box office results of opening weekend. Luckily, the film itself isn't just a step forward in representation, it's also a dang good piece of filmmaking. It should come as no surprise that the guy who made Fruitvale Station and Creed once again knocked it out of the park with Black Panther.Let's start with the cast because even before a single trailer, the cast was the thing that stood out of the most. For me, Chadwick Boseman stole the show in Civil War a few years ago. He made an even bigger impression than Tom Holland did as Spider-Man. His calm but fierce presence was unmatched and brought an entirely different vibe to the characters already in place in the MCU. Boseman, who has already played some pretty iconic people (Jackie Robinson, Thurgood Marshall, and James Brown), is perfecting the role of a lifetime right now.Alongside him is an incredibly talented supporting cast including Angela Bassett, Sterling K. Brown, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Andy Serkis, Forest Whitaker, and of course Michael B. Jordan. Nobody is wasted and all of them are well-written and fleshed out. Jordan instantly ranks in the top 3 or 4 Marvel villains (which isn't the hardest thing to do), and his performance as Killmonger was full of thoughtful planning and empathetic beats. So much so that I understood what he was doing and why he was doing, even if I don't agree as to how he was accomplishing his goals.But I've gone on far too long without mentioning the ladies of Black Panther. Wow did I love Gurira's noble and powerful turn as T'Challa's guard Okoye, Nyong'o's gentle but courageous turn as Nakia, and Wright's hilarious and energetic turn as Shuri (who is essentially Q to Boseman's Bond). There are other great beats by actresses in the film, but those 3 women are absolutely incredible in this film. There are some familiar story beats from say Thor or Iron Man, but I always say that even if a movie isn't original in story, but is presented and executed in a new way, then it's all worth it. Which is a very long way of saying , Black Panther is a uniquely satisfying piece of cinema that might as well change the way superhero films (perhaps all films) are directed, produced, written, and acted worldwide. Wishful thinking sure, but it seems like there's been a shift since Wonder Woman, so why not after Black Panther?9.0/10</review-text>

I especially enjoyed seeing the true Africa, not the mad up one with it's one note weather, but the beautiful, yet cold and snowing in the mountains as well. I would definitely go see it again.

I had been wanting to see Black Panther since T'Challa (aka Black Panther) played by Chadwick Boseman made his first appearance in Captain America: Civil War. The huge hype surrounding the film added to my desire to see it, and I can tell you now that Black Panther does indeed live up to the hype. Plus Black Panthers new costume is on point!</review-text>

		<review-text>When I first heard about this amazing film and how it was by people of color for people of color I was very pleased. We have never been in a super hero movie before and it was refreshing to see and as a person of color I felt empowered. Every time T'Challa jumped it was me jumping, everytime he holler it was me that guided his voice, everytime he punched it was me. He was very relatable unlike Tony Stark (yuck) who is rich and white, and the actor who played this black chocolate hero don't even get me started meow am I right girls, that is exactly the kind of eye candy a woman like me needed to get into the theatre. But the one thing I don't get is why would the director make such a handsome and powerful black character the embodiment of Drumph? He represents everything Drumph does. It makes me so mad why would you make such a beautiful movie but make me want to root for Drumph?! 2 stars for that chocolate mmm and the authentic Africana</review-text>

this was Lion King with the SAME MUSIC for gosh sakes!
The tech was good but not believable. The acting was good but preached about how black folks need more help from affluent black folks. And in the end they see the error in their ways and buy up a city block in apparently Chicago to teach kids math and science.
Yeah ...... the treachery was ok but once again a remake of Lion King.

		<review-text>Marvel always surprises me when I think they've run out of steam. Black Panther is what the 18th movie they've done? There seems to be no sign of them slowing down anytime soon, and for good reason. With the industry scrambling to find the next big cinematic universe/comic book franchise, there will never be another like what Marvel Studios has accomplished. We had Iron Man all the way back in 2008 and I never would've thought 10 years from then we'd be watching a Black Panther movie. I wasn't expecting much going into it, I figured it would be a decent action movie with a pretty familiar plot. In some ways it was, but in some ways it actually wasn't. These movies tend to fall under a pretty general third act with hero vs villain so I wasn't too thrilled by that part, but at least the action was well done so I let it slide. If anyone does anything like Fan4stick or Man of Steel ever again I'll walk out before it's even over. What Black Panther really shines in is it's world building through breaking the cultural barrier, I wondered going in how they were going to address the fact that Wakanda was this technological utopia when there are so many third world countries barely staying together. The answers they gave were satisfying at least for a comic book movie. You have a strong villain who's fueled with this hatred against the world for how they've treated African people and how Wakanda in has stood to the side all these years. Trying to not get involved of the obstacles African people are constantly struggling with all over the world. It's doing a lot right and I'm glad they took the time to tell a meaningful story that doesn't necessarily force a bridge into more movies, but rather contribute to the constant evolving world. By the end the characters make a decision that promises some interesting directions and possibilities and I'm genuinely curious to see where they could take it. Overall this movie was pretty satisfying. Great direction, performances, and plenty of popcorn action for a good time. If you enjoy these movies, obviously go see it, If you don't then I guess don't? I'm a bit surprised people are accusing positive reviews of being afraid to express their true opinions because they don't wanna come off as racist or offensive against SJW. But then again this is the internet so who am I kidding. We live in a day and age where people are looking to stand out online trying to look hip by saying the movie sucks because it's boring and what not. If you're going to critique something actually put some effort into it. Strip away the visuals and performances, then you got a pretty generic superhero story I agree, but what matters is the execution and effort they put into it. These movies are not Citizen Kane they're popcorn movies but they do a decent job that actually deserves the praise. There's a line T'chaka has in here about not building barriers but opening them and how we have to look after one another like we're a single tribe, humanity. The haters of Black Panther know I'm telling the truth and are going to downvote this review because they don't like people supporting Disney and their &quot;SJW agendas&quot;. Well all I gotta say is you're not fooling anyone as long as you put money down for that ticket, I'll see you at Infinity War!</review-text>

Jordan and the surprise cameo of Martin Freeman (During the movie i kept quoting the office in my head)</review-text>

		<review-text>Serviceable. As many positives this movie featured, the one word that popped up in my head constantly was: Serviceable.Don't get me wrong: the movie's good and there's not much to point to that's bad, but stripping away the great cast, incredible world-building universe and special effects, it's the most average origin story.The star and best part of the movie, Chadwick Boseman a.k.a. The Title Character, was fantastic and stole every scene. Granted, I would've liked to see him more in his full-body superhero outfit (you'll see as much of him as the Panther as you did Batman in The Dark Knight Rises. In other words, not much.) But, thankfully, he does carry the feature with his great chemistry with the cast and charisma on screen.As mentioned, the world these characters live in and their mythos was also great to see and unbelievably believable. I knew little to nothing about this comic book's background and for them to set it up so nicely that it became realty, was very welcomed.Also really nice was that this was a self-contained story in a huge universe. Never opposed to other Marvel characters showing up, even just to say: &quot;Greetings!&quot; but it's nice this stood alone. Of course, aside from the setup, that is.Boseman's T'Challa is still mourning the loss of his father in Captain America's Civil War movie...but, then again, it's only been a week since those events. Nevertheless, he needs to be the new King of his (certainly not a ****hole) nation of Wakanda, he needs to prove himself to his people, himself and his father's spirit and bring in a criminal who's taking a break from Middle Earth, Kong Island and this very MCU. There's much more to the story, but why ruin it?The movie takes itself very seriously and that's an ENORMOUS relief from Marvel's go-to formula: 80% comedies with 20% superheroing, i.e. Spider-Man: Homecoming, Iron Man Three, both Guardian of the Galaxies and Thor: Ragnarok. Those movies relied almost exclusively on humor and so little on what I bought a ticket for. Mercifully, they kept the humor - which was sometimes funny - to a minimum here.This isn't a movie I'd rush to see again, mostly because the main plot is so average and predictable, but it's definitely recommended to see once, especially for all the positives mentioned above. ***Final thoughts: As a favor and quasi-birthday gift to my friend, I agreed to stay and see the two post-credit scenes that I usually hate to waste my time waiting for. No spoiler to the content, but a warning: these were two of the lamest I've seen. The first is something we already knew was coming and the second is something we already knew about. There were no surprises and, AS ALWAYS, they were completely avoidable. They're always available online to see so you don't have to spend an extra 20 minutes in the theatre to see 3 seconds of blah.</review-text>

		<review-text>After 18 movies the MCU has delivered a spectacular surprise - Black Panhter. His debut in Civil war was one of the highlights of the movie, and everyone wanted to see him in action in his own movie. And here we are, faced with a very good action adventure that deals with extremely difficult questions and intends to have a great cultural impact. Now, that sounds a lot for an MCU movie, an unfortunately, it is.The thing that makes Black Panther a good movie is the acting, the visuals, the story and political-cultural critique of the modern day world. The acting is in every way superb with one exception. Boseman was, in regard to everyone else, overthrown. His acting is really, really good, but the problem is that he had to compete with the likes of Whitaker, Basset, Nyong'o, Jordan and (the great and powerful) Serkis. Not only does he find himself a little in the shadow of such great names, but certain newcomers such as Gurira do such a brilliant job that the main character actually becomes a little less interesting. But, do not mistake that fact with the fact that he does not act out the main protagonist in style - he does, and he does it very very well. On the other hand, Jordan dominates every scene with such ease it is almost disturbing. He is intimidating, dangerous, and has a great shift from a gangster looking and sounding persona to a legitimate Marvel villain halfway through the movie. His only problem was Serkis who, in many ways stole the movie. It is more fun to watch how much fun he had playing his character that one actually forgets to observe the surrounding story. Crazy, entertaining, fun and really the only character that stays with you long after the movie ends. On the other hand, Freeman did such a routine job that it almost hurt to see. He does function as a supporting character but seems disinterested and distant in many ways. A shame.The visuals were impressive. The colors and contrasts of the Wakandan city to the bleak standard city depictions, the traditional African wardrobe and breathtaking scenery really make Black Panther worth more than just one watch. The musical background fulfills the ambient of the movie and gives every scene another layer of depth. So, the movie does have an atmosphere worth noticing.The main problem with Black Panther is the fact it tries to deal with extremely important modern day problems (immigration, gun control, racism etc.). Now, the problem is that MCU has a way of portraying difficult subjects in a lighthearted manner. Black Panther is not lighthearted (thank God), but still does not pass that necessary boundary to make it a difficult and important movie. Passing that boundary is risky and does not always pay off (e.g. BvS Dawn of justice), but after 18 movies and such a fan base, a little risk should not present a problem. Simply noticing in a sentence or two problems of immigration (&quot;If we let them in, they bring their problems with them...&quot;) or gang related shootings (&quot;No tears for me?&quot; &quot;Nah, that's just how things go around here.&quot;), accompanied by a minute or two of heartwarming scenes is not enough. It is noteworthy, but more should have been done. The director does a marvelous job at that, but I fear studio interference took it's tole here.Another great problem this movie tries to discuss is the conflict of traditional and modern day views. It is, maybe, the heart and soul of Black Panther but it feels a bit undone. It is unknown if this can be pinned to the problems of the script or the direction. Knowing how Coogler makes his movies (e.g. Creed), I'll go with script. This problem feels one dimensional, and it should not be. This is a problem that plagues the Middle east today, and dealing with it in such a way does not do it justice. That combination should have been explored more, worked out more, and the overall impact the movie would have had, would have been far greater.All in all, Black panther is an improvement over the last few MCU movies. It establishes a direction that was much needed after the catastrophe that way Ragnarok, and seems like a transitional movie towards the Infinity wars. Superbly acted, decently written, greatly directed, but flat and one dimensional at points when dealing with difficult subjects. Well done. Really well done.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is another not only MCU triumph, but a Comic book movie triumph. Chadwick Boseman give live to T'Challa and The Black Panther. He is yet another example of the amazing choice for casting lead MCU roles. The rest of the cast shines in every moment, from the main support cast to the little roles and cameos. Michael B. Jordan is as Killmonger is one of the best MCU and Comic book movies villains of all time. His motives are clear and relatable. He is used in the right way and where he is needed to. Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira and Letitia Wright as the main women of the film execute their roles in an spectacular way. They are selfaware, bold in ther choices and fun to watch. It was very pleasing to see that Freeman get a more deep role through the movie than just a short cameo. Andy Serkis made Klaw crazy and unpredictable, and a very good second villain for the movie. But one of the most terrific things in the movie is the representation of Wakanda. It looks and feels alive. Every shot is an art. Accompanied by the soundtrack it increase the richness of Wakanda and its mythology.The movie only flaw is that it doesn't have much of a turning points. It's pretty straight forward. Maybe there are one or two, but not on the level, let say of Civil War or Thor Ragnarok. However this doesn't hinder the great story of the movie and its narrative. There is some noticeable at the 3rd act, but it's doesn't take you away from the action in any way.
Black Panther is another solid entry for the MCU. It feels different and for the most of it's parts self contained(for a 18th MCU movie). We can hope to see the greatness of T'Challa yet again in Infinity War.</review-text>

		<review-text>Due to the recent over saturation of the superhero genre, most of us have developed a fatigue to these movies by now and are tired of seeing the same old thing rehashed over and over again. 
This was my biggest concern walking into this movie, so I kept my expectations low even throughout all the praise that Black Panther has been getting. I didn't wanna see the same story for the 19th time. Well, may you rest at peace because Black Panther is NOT that, it's an exciting, fresh take on all the tropes that we are so bored of. I would even go as far to say that it may be the most memorable and highest quality film Marvel has produced since Civil War. Sure, Doctor Strange was visually cool, Guardians was okay, Spiderman was better than other Spidermans and Thor was fun, but Black Panther stands out from the crowd. For the most part, it solves my biggest problem that 99% of superhero films struggle with, which is pointless and weak villains. The movie starts off with (super minor spoilers?) it's secondary villain, who is a familiar and exciting character that I really enjoy seeing on screen - Ulysses Klaue. He's fun, energetic, crazy, unpredictable and cool. But later as the movie is developing, a new brand of Marvel villain emerges, Killmonger. He has everything that modern villains lack - moral dilemma, comprehensive motivation, solid plan. You understand him and you sympathise with his reasoning, understanding why he has to do what he's doing. It's not your typical pure overpowered evil forces from outer space here to conquer for no reason. It's a human who wants to fix the world and do something right, someone who believes that they are doing good. Also, I enjoyed that the conflict of the movie was scaled (for the most part) and we didn't see any &quot;world ending&quot; implications or over the top CGI laser spewing magic boss battles (that look more like a video game cutscene than a movie, I'm looking at you Justice League). Both Black Panther and Killmonger were equally matched. Nobody was overpowered. The stakes were set at the exact right level, which gives me really high hopes for the upcoming Avengers movie. I don't know if this movie necessarily will withstand the test of time but what I know for sure that I really enjoyed it. In fact, it's a great movie that could be watched as a stand-alone film outside of the MCU, that doesn't require previous knowledge of comic book lore. From a cinematic standpoint, I really enjoyed that this movie mashes so many of the familiar things that you know and love and puts them in one movie and NAILS it. It doesn't feel forced but you feel the genuine love and care that was there behind scenes. You can tell that this was a movie made by people who like movies. There are moments where it feels like it could be a scene from the universes like James Bond, Fast and the Furious, Lion King, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and a million other things and it feels good. It was an awesome and epic ride that made me feel like a kid again. Other than a few cheesy jokes that felt a little bit out of place à la &quot;hey there fellow kids&quot;, there is really nothing to nitpick. 
I have to applaud literally every single department that's worked on this movie - the cinematography, the special effects, the set design, costumes, music, sound design, acting, etc, all of it was top notch. Overal, fantastic watch that's worth going to the theatre for. 
Also, for those who are concerned that this is a liberal aimed progressive movie that's gonna shove &quot;social justice warrior&quot; things down your throat? You're just plain wrong. It doesn't feel forced at all, in fact, it felt more natural than a LOT of movies that are coming out these days.P/SBetter than Wonder Woman, which I also enjoyed.</review-text>

		<review-text>In this day and age, the studios are under a lot more pressure to represent different nationalities and backgrounds. Those that are asking for it are right; it's important for black children to have black role models as it is for LBGT individuals to have role models that are just like them. Many artists and directors want to adapt and give people something different, but they also understand that studios are still trying to make a profit. That's not to say an African-American lead can't draw an audience, but movie making is expensive, so they have to make sure that whatever they put on the screen can draw in all people of interest. In the case of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, they've done well so far with bringing in black stars. We've got Samuel L. Jackson for Nick Fury, Anthony Mackie as Falcon from the Captain America films, and Don Cheadle as Rhodes from the Iron Man movies. One of the surprise popular characters to debut was Chadwick Boseman from Captain America: Civil War as the Black Panther. The character has not only led his own series in comics that's still running, but is the only African-based hero I'm aware of. Let's see how he does on his own in Black Panther. In the hidden country of Wakanda, it has created groundbreaking technology, thanks to it's source of a rare substance called vibranium that landed via comet thousands of years ago. Though much of it could have benefitted mankind, the leaders and previous kings have made the decision to isolate themselves from the world.After the events of Captain America: Civil War, T'Challa (Played by Chadwick Boseman) is crowned king and reigning heir to the mantle of the Black Panther. It's revealed that along with the suit that's made from it, he gets his internal powers from vibranium. When he hears that a Wakanda artifact is being sold underground, he travels to Hong Kong along with his sister Shuri (played by Letitia Wright), his ex-lover and spy Nakia (played by Lupita Nyong'o), and proud warrior Okoye (played by Danai Gurira). Though they capture Ulysses Klaue (played by Andy Serkis), he's broken out, thanks to his boss Erik &quot;Killmonger&quot; Stevens (Played by Michael B. Jordan). By the time T'Challa and his group return to Wakanda, Erik reveals his identity as a tribal son and challenges him for the throne. T'Challa loses, is thrown down a waterfall, and Erik gets ready to ship out much of the Wakanda technology to black markets. Will T'Challa manage to stop him?Many people have been touting Black Panther as a grand and revolutionary super hero story that different. While I don't know if I can call this different and revolutionary, Black Panther is a very entertaining movie regardless. It's clear that director Ryan Coogler (Creed) not only wanted to show a different hero, but a different world together. The two best elements to the movie are the side characters and the setting.When it comes to who the movie is following, it tries to give us a lot of characters...and it does work. I liked Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurria, Andy Serkis, and especially Letitia Wright. The winner here is Michael B. Jordan who plays one of the better Marvel villains. While he is physically powerful and intimidating, he also makes a compelling case for the mistakes that Wakanda has made by it's isolationist polices. While he isn't bad by any means, the least interesting character was the Black Panther himself. He does carry a royal energy of leadership; he doesn't seem to have that same struggle for mistakes of his countries history that I got from Michael B. Jordan. I think the script could have done better with that, and show him how he earns his mantle back. The movie does try to show out hero at his worst before he tries to fix everything, the story still succumbs to typical superhero tropes. Now having said that, what they do with Wakanda is really cool. This design reminded me of The Guardians of the Galaxy movies, in which things are very colorful and lively. It seems the overall goal was to create an African utopia and everything from the architecture to the costumes are great. I wish there was a video game to Black Panther, just so that I can get a better glimpse into this country and it's culture.I'll give this seven Black Panther helmets out of ten. In a large sea of superhero movies, and even within Marvel superhero stories, Black Panther manages to remain it's own unique thing. I had fun watching it and families will probably be pleased with it. Give it a watch and see it's powerful roar.</review-text>

		<review-text>This 2018 action film stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira and Martin Freeman based on the Marvel comics.
Boseman plays T'challa, a young man who becomes ruler of African 
kingdom, Wakanda after his father's death. Wakanda is a technologically advanced place which helps T'challa become superhero, Black Panther. 
Soon, he meets dangerous, ex-soldier, Erik who wants to overthrow him
and rule Wakanda. Nyong'o plays Nakia, T'challa's ex-lover, Gurira plays Okoye, one of his bodyguards, Freeman plays CIA agent, Ross and creator,
Stan Lee makes an amusing cameo as usual. Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Sterling K. Brown and Andy Serkis also appear. This is ok,
but I think it could've been better because it dragged in certain places and was too long. Boseman and Jordan are great in it though and the effects are amazing. I'd still give this a try at least once if you're into comic books/superheroes.</review-text>

One of the biggest complaints about Marvel Movies is the lack of compelling villains. That is definitely not the problem in the Black Panther.

		<review-text>Hey all, with Avengers Infinity Wars is around the corner Black Panther is roaring at the box office worldwide. You can't miss this extravaganza, because if you do so then actually you are missing an art film which is crafted so well that each frame is splendid. Since release, people are talking about this movie and already broke some opening weekend collections at the box office surpassing major superhero/action films.From the start to the last, every scene is scripted well in a manner that you will definitely realize how a king should be. It took 10 years &amp; 17 movies to bring this connection between characters especially the king T'Challa aka Black Panther. Last you saw him in Captain America Civil War which made everyone want this character more and led this epic movie to be a success.The movie is all about a fictional nation Wakanda (in South Africa) and element Vibranium (fictional). The story revolves around T'Challa his family, foes and loved ones where Politics is much more highlighted. The strong bond between T'Challa &amp; Shuri is really appreciable which is rarely seen in any movies. The tech used by Wakanda is far more ahead than any of Tony's techs. The leader of Special forces/chief security head of the king is loyal to the kingdom. In between, you may feel that you are seeing Hollywood version of Kattappa (Baahubali).Movie lags in between which is correct because Director Ryan Coogler wants the audience to understand the character very well which they can later connect him with other members of the Avengers team. He is not only the King of Wakanda but also the King of MCU and he deserves the respect. Because many questions will be answered at the end and we can expect some blast in Avengers Infinity Wars. Actions sequences are for more well choreographed. Wakanda kingdom, people, traditions etc are visualized beautifully. Official movie runtime is 130 minutes which is honestly acceptable for this wonderful movie. Many things to be said, but this much is enough and rest you can experience at nearby theatres.Tony Stark is definitely going to be jealous of him. Must watch movie for everyone.Bold, Beautiful &amp; Epic. Ratings: 4.5/5</review-text>

		<review-text>I was a little apprehensive going into the movie just because of allthe hype around it. Many times movies can't live up to it. This one? Exceeded all my expectations! The casting was perfect. The visuals, amazing. I was amazed at the detail that went into the costumes and jewelry, and how they reflect those of real African people from around the continent. And the story was great. There were some kinda predictable things, and it did fall into a pretty typical Marvel trope of the good guy getting help from the &quot;bad but not as bad&quot; guy. However, it was never trite or boring. The character development was wonderful. Speaking of characters, I am so appreciative of the fact that the women in this movie were fully recognized humans! They had their own thoughts and feelings and actions separate from the main character, which isn't all that common. This movie deserves every bit of hype around it. Can't wait to see what Black Panther and the rest of the crew from Wakanda do in Infinity War and beyond.</review-text>

		<review-text>With so many superhero stories, we all know the story: there is a good guy and some bad guys, but the good guy wins. 
But, this move is actually different enough to be interesting and exciting. It is colorful (spoiler: I love the costumes at the waterfall challenge scene). I like the distribution of male and female characters (very refreshing!). The scenery is a combination of fantastic and international. Acting is good. 
Good movie!</review-text>

		<review-text>Yes, it has its own political orientation. Yes, you have seen parts of this movie before. Yes, there is a whole lot of CGI in this film. If you like Superhero movies (and I'm underwhelmed by most of them), you'll probably like Black Panther.The cast is first rate and pulls it off. I liked the leader of the Gorilla tribe and his devotional praise of Hanuman, even if that particular mythological figure is more Indian than African. It was still a clever touch, and hopefully some schoolkid somewhere does his proverbial homework and looks that name up.The visuals are generally good if not a little derivative of movies like Thor, The Avengers, or maybe even Star Wars: Episode One at the end. There's a lot of Wonderwoman, Batman, and even some Casino Royale thrown into the script. there's maybe even a passive resemblance to Elysium in some of this movie's themes. I feel like I've seen massive underground mines/dwellings in a lot of films over the years. However, the more movies you see, the more you see them in other movies. Eventually age catches up with all of us, and our taste in films sadly is not spared the blunting of memory to dilute the sensuous new. Alas, this movie is definitely made for children and teens.Yes, the film is not perfect. Klaue dies way to early, much like another recent Andy Serkis character which will not be named here. I wish that the MCU would start using more practical effects in lieu of the expansive CGI that permeates these films. Christopher Nolan and Ridley Scott need to give these Feige and company a few pointers. I could have done without some of the Urban Street art that permeates the imagery of the film, especially in the lab and Wakandan street scenes. It just seemed out of place here to me but, overall, the artistic conception of this film is pretty solid. In the end, it's a comic book movie and you'll ether like it or you won't. I liked it</review-text>

		<review-text>Dear readers, Black Panther is here to remove all your prejudices about Africa and racism that counters the Africans, eventhough the word &quot;black&quot; here is not representing African continent, but the power of hero, like a Panther, whose the color is black. So, the Black Panther movie is not just about a hero, but also politics among nations. The term hero is because the source of Black Panther energy is made only for heroes and the term of politic is main of whole story plot. It is about a new King replaces former King, but the former King had some mistakes on the past, so that the new King must remove and heal the wound of the nations, but in the same time, he must also take sacrifices to do the right thing for protecting Wakanda people. That's why the tagline &quot;Wakanda forever&quot; becomes viral and now everybody wants to do tourism in Africa because the landscape is so beautiful and the Director could mixed up the African continent with highly technology, as similar as other sci-fi movies. The plot also contents the girl power; because the highest military commander of Wakanda is a woman and all women had their essential parts for the development of the movie character. Some of wardrobe of women look like Xena the warrior princesses, that is compatible with wardrobe of the men that is more modern. The story is easygoing, not to hard, because the reverse memories are only in some scenes, so that the other scenes are just going forward. We hope that there will be Black Panther 2!! :)</review-text>

		<review-text>For far too long, Marvel Studios' PR department has been waging a sustained assault on us patrons' psyche with over-the-top promotional material, ranging from comic conventions, merchandising, endless trailers/previews and cultural references. Whoever is heading that unit needs to take a vacation, along with the staff. Immediately. This is a serious request.Because what we have been led to believe is Black Panther is the best superhero film ever made on the legendary African warrior.This film is nothing of the kind. Instead, it is a compelling and competent drama of greed, loyalty, vengeance, and social standing. Other reviewers have pointed out that this film is quite overrated and not worthy of the hype. To be very honest, that was my feeling as soon as the credits rolled. It was a few minutes later that my appreciation of the film's tone and import started to change. This film is not about a fictional kingdom or a mysterious metal or other tangible things. It is more a study of who we are as a human race and where we stand today.I will try not to spoil the film for others. There are numerous scenes where characters wrestle with their inner conscience, confront a dilemma or two, and balance critical decisions with consequences. These scenes are not hoisted out of reality, we experience moments like these ourselves. Circumstances can make past decisions look outdated and wrong, even. At the same time, embracing change a little too quickly has pitfalls as well. There is a line said by a male character, which goes thus: &quot;It is tough for a good man to be a leader&quot;. And it is true. Not everyone is born a leader. People learn and evolve over time, dealing with situations that sometimes are beyond their control. And by presenting those situations, the filmmakers have chosen a path that can be a little underwhelming to viewers at first, but relatable to us in some ways. I would even go as far as to say the overall theme of this film is more about what we are willing to do to protect who or what defines us without losing sight of what unites us all. It does sound serious, but the film manages to tackle these topics. Not expertly, but in a reasonably convincing fashion.The cast is near-perfect. While Chadwick Boseman could have done better by adding a little spark to his T'Challa, he has an extraordinary screen presence in the guise of the titular hero. A simultaneous ninja-statesman, his brand of aggression, without any outward weapons, is ferocious and decisive. Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o are excellent as General Okoye and War Dog Nakia respectively. Their fight sequences are superbly choreographed, along with those of the others. Michael B Jordan's acting chops are legit, he exudes menace and power as Killmonger. Daniel Kaluuya is a strong addition to an already-impressive line-up. But I was most impressed by Letitia Wright as Princess Shuri, the feisty younger sibling of the King. A firebrand techno-genius who can handle a skirmish quite capably, some of her inventions make Iron Man's creations pale in comparison. I expect to see more of her in future installments, if the post-credits scene is anything to go by. Seasoned veterans like Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, John Kani, and Sterling K Brown support the main cast with their renowned expertise. And not for the first time, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis' scenes together are a delight to watch. While Freeman does provide some comic relief, it is also refreshing to see him get actively involved and bring his own skills to the table. As for the crew, one important point first: bear in mind, the director is a relative newcomer in the competitive world of big-budget superhero franchises. I have not seen Fruitvale Station or Creed yet, but Ryan Coogler had a lot on his plate when entrusted with the enviable task of directing this highly-anticipated venture. He delivers a really watchable film, even if some adrenaline junkies might complain that the action sequences are few and far between. By choosing to focus on drama and intrigue instead of fast-paced, mind-numbing action (my number one reason for hating Avengers: Age of Ultron), Coogler makes a calculated move to pose questions about ourselves. His crew back him up admirably, whether it is Rachel Morrison with the camera (some of the wide-angle shots were gorgeous), special effects, or music. The production design is top-notch, the sweeping, high-tech interiors of Wakanda contrasting rather charmingly with the rustic, almost-idyllic outdoors. At just a touch over 2 hours long, the pace is neither too rushed nor sluggish.My sincere advice to those who have not seen this film yet: if possible, erase the sky-high expectations caused by Marvel's hype-machine and watch for what it really is. You will probably enjoy it more.8/10</review-text>

		<review-text>Her it is, the last MCU movie before the long awaited Infinity War, Black panther is a movie that trys to be more than a surehero film, it has a racial message underline with a shakespearean and lion king backstory.
Probably they shouldn't have killed Ullysses Klaue so easily( great perfomance by Andy Serkis) but Killmonger is a cool bad guy too.
Two things leading to Infinity war, first we have alot of wakandian tech and vibranium to the fight against Thanos and we have Bucky Barnes back who is bound to have a huge part of the film</review-text>

		<review-text>I just came from the cinema after hearing rave reviews about Black Panther over the weekend. I was looking forward to seeing it before it became the #1 topic everywhere after seeing the character of T'Challa introduced in Civil War, but I guess I kind of allowed the reviews to influence me going into it because I was expecting something truly unique and special. And as the movie went on, I was having fun but I was waiting for those outstanding, memorable moments to arrive. They sadly never did.Nevertheless, Black Panther made me feel the same way I felt after watching many of the MCU movies that I liked- it was a fun ride, but one I'm probably not going to go on again. What I liked most was the overall look and feel of the movie. Wakanda was stunning, offering a blend of sci-fi tech with more traditional African look that's rarely seen in superhero films and for me it worked. I really loved all the ritualistic elements of this fictional society, their tradition, individual styles, hierarchy and so on. Almost every moment on Wakanda was a good time. I also liked the performances from this cast, Chadwick Boseman and MBJ stood out and delivered it most of the time, whether in dramatic or more comedic moments. Action was also good, however I feel there wasn't enough of it. Black Panther action moments from Civil War were more memorable to me than the one's from his own movie.On a bit of a negative side, the pacing didn't always work for me making the movie feel a bit long. I wish more time was dedicated to Killmonger and his clash with T'Challa, both physically and ideologically. The middle part in Korea was fun but felt a bit pointless in the end. The end fight between two panthers was a bit of a letdown, set in a tight, dark environment. Also, it looked very much like a video game by the end, kind of like Justice League, with both characters looking like they were digitally made for the entire fight. The political and social themes in the movie were not very subtle, as expected. In the end, I got from BP what I really should have expected, which is not a bad thing. Great look and feel, good, effective soundtrack, solid characters and mostly fun action made this an entertaining 2 hours in the cinema.</review-text>

		<review-text>Once again, Marvel have created a brilliant and epic standalone movie which should please audiences globally. Similar to Thor and Civil War there are elements of humour but also a serious and engaging plot. There are also brilliant action scenes thanks to great directing and casting.The movie also has a strong message which is that diversity and cultural acceptance is essential for economic and technological development.Not one to be missed.

		<review-text>I've read many of the reviews already posted, and I'm really surprised of the wide range of opinions. I truly feel like some who are giving it a poor rating wanted to dislike it from the beginning. Having said that, I admit I was looking forward to this movie for sometime, but I wasn't expecting it to live up to the hype. 
I think this is one of the best Marvel movies they have ever made. Visually it was stunning. The action was top notch. But beyond all that, I thought the story was great and well written. Michael B. Jordan stole the show and was convincing in his anger and thirst for revenge. 
Overall, I loved it and thought that everyone involved did a great job. I'm sure I'll see it again in the theater and I'll probably buy it down the road.</review-text>

		<review-text>After nearly two years since Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther leaps onto the scene and gets his own movie; and what a great surprise this movie was for me.
Marvel's movies have gotten a little derivative for some, and I think Black Panther is something of a multicultural response to that criticism: the movie evokes The Lion King, Skyfall, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Thor and Wonder Woman while creating an identity of its own; the panther is no Batman clone I can assure you of that.Ryan Coogler writes, co-produces and directs the film with surprising ease and boy this man knows how to infuse style into franchised movies; we've got the first blaxploitation superhero movie of the age, and it has A LOT to say about war, entitlement, morality, political (&amp; cultural) unity and feminism. This movie is a broadly appealing triumph of genre filmmaking with culturally distinct aesthetics that are otherwise outside the mainstream. Afro-filmmaking got a tonne of coverage in the 70s, and it looks like that with the likes of Black Panther and Get Out, filmmaking made by, and centred around, black people is making a long overdue comeback. With Hollywood stars like Forest Whitaker and Lupita Nyong'o gracing Black Panther it's amazing that there are directors like Coogler are at long-last getting into the mainstream scene.I love this film; it's a global semi-political-conspiracy thriller that takes place in Africa, South Korea and the United States and utilises those locations as beautifully as the typical Bond film does.Black Panther is a must-see of the highest order, and good job on MARVEL for making all of this possible!</review-text>
		<review-title>I personally loved this movie! Lovely, vibrant addition to the MCU.</review-title>

		<review-text>First of all let me tell you this: DO NOT believe the people who say this movie is bad ok?
 You can clearly see in these reviews that the most recent are the ones that qualify the movie as being great (8-10 stars) and almost every older review says the movie is crap. 
Why you ask? Because the older ones are from people who hadn´t even seen the movie and were just trying to harm its reputation (you can see this because this movie´s score on IMDb started out as 6,7 stars a week ago and is currently at 7,7)Moving on... This movie is a visual masterpiece and, in my opinion, is one of the 3/5 best Marvel movies because:A - Like I said, the movie is technically perfect and everyone agrees on that... The wakandian costumes are beautifully crafted, the set pieces are amazing, the special effects are on point at all times and the sounstrack... its just perefct in every single moment (kudos to Kendrick Lamar btw)
Examples: The last fight sequence with the rhinos, all fight sequences with the dora milaje, the korea car chase, etc...B - A lot of people said the acting is bad... FALSE... the acting is as good as it gets in a Marvel movie... Not oscar-worthy of course... but I think Angela Basset and Letitia Wright (Black Panther´s mom and sister, respectively) delivered top notch performancesC - People also said the story is not original and it´s predictable... Look, of course it´s not amazingly original... But hardly any movie´s plot in present time is... However, the story is captivating and well told and it really doesn´t matter a lot in a Marvel movie if the story is really original as long as it´s well executed and allows the viewer to understand the film´s context (which it does in this case)D - The villain isn´t good? Give me a break! This is basically Marvel´s best villain yet (alongside witth Loki)... Good backstory, charismatic and not just another bad guy with lots of guns but someone who actually holds political significance in his plan, like a real villain shouldE - People saying the movie was overhyped and because of that critics aren´t giving their honest opinions... Man this allegations are so stupid and cliché... Critics give their honest opinions, wether you agree with them or not... You know another overhyped movie that critics bashed nonetheless? Suicide Squad! And man was I looking forward to that mess...
Now don´t begin with the whole &quot;critics always support Marvel and hate on DC&quot; talk ok? Critics rightfully loved Wonder Woman because it was good, not because they were paid to...And they did the exact same with this glorious Marvel achievement! Please see this one. Ignore the pointless haters, because this one is quite something...</review-text>
		<review-title>Absolutely blown away by this movie!!</review-title>

		<review-text>I am very happy that director Ryan Coogler does not hide his politics in this movie. &quot;Black Panther&quot; celebrates African culture, Pan-Africanism, and Black Power with stunning visuals and excellent fight scenes. I especially enjoyed seeing African-American women portrayed as highly intelligent and strong. Almost anyone who loved the female warriors in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; will really enjoy the fierce African-American female warriors in this film. I also like that the film does not reduce the fictional Wakanda to an African utopia. &quot;Black Panther&quot; shows intertribal conflict and violence.Overall, Black Panther is a highly entertaining and somewhat politically &quot;woke&quot; film. I do not know if typical Marvel comic books fans will appreciate the movie's very visible political agenda. I do know that the movie has broken box office records and that Hollywood executives worship profits. &quot;Black Panther&quot; appears to become a highly profitable venture for Disney. Perhaps this movie's success will prompt Disney to make and distribute more movies that feature African-Americans and other people of color as superheroes. &quot;Black Panther&quot; demonstrates that highly political comic book adaptations can be very profitable. I think that is a very good thing.</review-text>

		<review-text>Long Live The King! Whatever I say about the movie will be a little. Definitely &quot;Black Panther&quot; takes its place as one of the strongest movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The cast is probably the best in a Marvel solo movie. &quot;Black panther&quot; shows an unseen part of the MCU - Wakanda, their tribes, secrets and their way of life.Indeed, one of the strongest features of the film is the acting of everyone in this movie. I can't say only one name, but Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Andy Serkis, Danai Gurira, Angela Basset, Letita Wright and Forest Whitaker are just some of the best characters in this movie.The story is really strong, which makes the movie so good. Michael B. Jordan played the role of Erik Killmonger brutally. After the movie ends, the villain gets stuck in your mind, just because you understand his motivation and is presented perfectly. If you have not become Chadwick Boseman's fan in &quot;Captain America: Civil War,&quot; it's inevitable now! T'Challla must lead his people, be king and hero at the same time, which is a heavy burden. Every scene between him and his sister Shuri is a pleasure. She is only 16 years old, but her intellect can be compared to that of Tony Stark and Bruce Banner.Special attention should be paid to every action scene. Movements and choreography are just unparalleled. You will make sure you see Black Panther, Killmonger and Okoye in action.The colors in this movie are unique! The effects are great. At some point you will think that some things are not necessary, but you will eventually see that everything is done with intent. I give an example with the new Black Panther suit, which has many new and useful features.The soundtrack is among the best of all Marvel movies so far, culled by Kendrick Lamar. After the end of the movie you will want to listen to the soundtrack again and again.The film does not have a weak spot, it introduces the story of Wakanda in depth, introduces us to many new characters, all of whom are great. The soundtrack and action scenes are one of the many perfect combinations in this movie. The villain is memorable and the acting is on a whole new level.In the future, &quot;Black Panther&quot; will be one of the often watched Marvel movies, as T'Challa is a person who easily gains the audience's sympathy, and you will not have passion to see him in &quot;Avengers: Infinity War&quot;.In conclusion, if you want an amazing experience, watch the movie as soon as possible!</review-text>

		<review-text>A great addition to the MCU. Great acting, beautiful visuals and some intense action. First impressive thing I noticed was its rich attention to detail in world building and its characters. My only criticism, I would have like to have seen more of the Killmonger character, as I feel they didn't go far enough with him. Over-all, this is a fun and enjoyable movie with action, comedy, drama. There are some complex social political overtones mixed in, but it never feels heavy handed, and I feel that the over-all message is positive for humanity as a whole. If this type of movie isn't your cup of tea, fair enough, but if you are on the fence about watching due to pre-conceived notions about its content and message, I would recommend you give it a try, and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</review-text>

		<review-text>I've been looking forward to seeing this forever and it didn't disappoint. I'm not a huge Marvel fan but I'll check out the films that catch my interest and the trailer for this one hooked me early. (Also side note the soundtrack is killer. I've been listening to it ever since it dropped.) I do love how Marvel finds a distinct subgenre within the superhero genre for all of their movies. This almost had a Shakespearean flavor to it with the palace intrigue and watching heroes plot and battle for the throne. Stellar performances across the board. I was surprised by how effective Michael B Jordan was as the villian as he's always such a charmer. I'm very disappointed by all the negative reviews that seem to be part of the pre announced campaign by racist trolls to smear the movie like they did with The Last Jedi. If a movie isn't your thing that's one thing but to attack a film because it's lead by black actors or has a female protagonist... you're time of blatant bigotry is up folks. Join the rest of us and live in a world where respect for everyone is the standard or learn to live in the shadows and have your voice ignored like the rest of us have since the dawn of time.</review-text>

The social justice preaching was nowhere near as bad as I anticipated, In fact the film was critical of both oppression by whites and also the failings of Wakanda to help other black people.

		<review-text>Visually pleasing, decent acting, some laughs, good action scenes, but overall disappointing, mostly due to its non-stop political agenda. Other than the last scene, which was left undeveloped and rather unbelievable, the entire objective of the movie went around two political stands - separation for the good of the few, with total disregard for the starving masses outside, or revenge for hurts that had been done to some long gone ancestors by some long gone ancestors, with an attitude of &quot;kill all to rule all&quot;... Why waste a potentially good movie to accomplish an obvious propaganda driven goal? Pity, left disappointed...</review-text>

		<review-text>I had a huge expectation about this solo Black Panther movie after whatever little of him in Captain America - Civil War movie left me very impressed. I mean, that movie was the first time I got introduced to the Black Panther character and I was instantly bowled by his black suit, mask and how he fights(no guns or fancy gadgets, just his claws &amp; kicks..). But with this solo venture, I didn't get to see him in a pure fight except for the intro encounter with some rogues in a forest. The action in the rest of the movie is more about his fancy gadgets, Spiderman like jumps or other visual effects show off. When I entered the theatre, Black Panther was my fav Marvel character. When I left, it ceased to be. That tells it all. They made him like the James Bond or the Iron Man of Wakanda with all the latest gadgets to save his a**! Black Panther's USP, I feel, is his hand to hand combats, kicks and ofcourse that suit that can take on anything earthly atleast. Making him fly around like Spiderman or use toys makes him no different from other Marvel or DC super heroes and one loses interest eventually.The movie is otherwise a decent entertainer especially the first half. There are lot of hilarious moments as well especially among the Panther and his sister Shuri or from the hugely built Mbaku, the chief of another tribe whom Panther fights for the throne. Among the performances, Chadwick Boseman fits into the Panther role very well. Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia, Panther's love is breathtakingly beautiful. Martin Freeman also makes his presence felt but somehow I think these kinda roles don't suit him at all or explore his potential the way the Hobbit did. My fav performance among the cast is from the brilliant Andy Serkis as the ruthless trader Ulysses Klaue. It's refreshing to see him perform purely as an actor for a movie than just prance around in a body suit. And finally the climax...well, I didn't stay back for the post credit scenes but it wouldn't have made me any less disappointed. Really the story could have done less with the technology in Wakanda or the glory of metal vibranium and more about the man T'Challa(the Black Panther), some realistic action and his emotional struggles to save his family or the world.Verdict - a nice entertainer but next time let the Panther hunt without his toys!</review-text>

		<review-text>Being an avid book reader, I have watched all but 2 or 3 comic book adaptations since the late 1970s. I have witnessed the change in tone and approach, as well as the the whole world-building process take root in the recent adaptations as the times inevitably changed. What Marvel has done so far is much more commendable than DC, and many examples of Marvel movies of the last 10 years are the living proof of that. However, not all of these adaptations are on par with what we may get to call all-time greats, and I am afraid -despite all the high grades given to the movie by critics- Black Panther is one of them. Black Panther actually happens to be one of my favorite characters along with Thor, a few X-men and Green Lantern. Time and again, I have read it with utter joy and fulfillment, and have always looked forward to the next issue. Therefore, this movie was one which I looked forward to with extreme enthusiasm. And maybe it was this same enthusiasm that ruined the movie for me, but I sincerely doubt it. So, as to how I see the movie:OK, so the casting is right on target, no quarrels there. And so are the visual effects and the setting of the story. However, the story is somewhat shallow, and needlessly comedic at places where it shouldn't be.Marvel (Disney) has lately started to follow a certain pattern of writing scripts, just like in the Bond movies. A hero, a romantic interest, a villain, a side-kick (or someone who takes on the role of Q from those Bond movies), a moral dilemma... and we are set. This one here is no different, only -as I have said before- somewhat shallow. Also, there happens to be more than one coincidental occurrence which make the story a lot less believable, if you care about those things. All of a sudden, an unexpected piece falls into place, a miraculous twist happens, someone appears out of thin air, and voila... all is well.The movie that could have delivered so much more at us, ends up delivering a script which can be summarized in just 2 sentences, and a story full of plot holes.So, how come such a movie garner so much praise, and such high marks? I dunno, honestly, but I have a theory. Ultimately, I feel like it would be safe to say that this movie was sort of a hype created to promote a black super hero in these trying times and during the re-emergence of needless and disturbing racial tendencies. It was during these times the movie was shot and as such promoted to emphasize equality and fairness among all people. Which is all good and fine, but it still could have done that with a stronger script, with a more coherent and fuller story. The fact that it gets so many high notes is not because of the film that it is, but because of the film it was intended to be. At least, this is my take on the movie, and how the film was reviewed so highly.I just hope the next installment in the Black Panther saga delivers more, just like the Winter Soldier delivered after the first Captain America adaptation.</review-text>

		<review-text>All of my friends said that this movie was awesome and that it was amazing. I went in there thinking that was what i was gonna think, but i was wrong. If you haven't seen any of the trailers, don't. You might enjoy this movie. The trailer gives away almost every cool part of the movie. I liked Chadwick Boesman as Black Panther. He did excellent. I think the movie should've had him in it more.The villain was great but I didn't like that they got rid of Andy Serkis, They had a great thing going with his arm that was made of vibranium. It was literally one of the reasons I came into the film. I wanted more of him in it. I also thought that the villain had a motivation that ended as soon as he got impaled by that spear. Did he just give up as soon as he was taken to the sunset? I also thought there was too much king drama. I wanted more fight sequences. There were more &quot;Challenges&quot; than actual confrontations.Overall, I liked the film but I didn't think it was the best Marvel movie since Iron Man.</review-text>

		<review-text>Visually, the movie is rich great eye candy. But form the perspective of a story, this is Thor, or any other good vs bad family feud. In the Marvel universe there is nothing new here. While I am happy to see an attempt at diversity, Calling this character the 'Black Panther' and staging the story the way they did, felt like pandering. As with many superheros, you have to consider the context of the time period in which they are created. Black Panther was created in 1966 at the height of the US Civil Rights movement. There are several areas that do not make sense. For example, if Vibranium (really?) were that powerful, then why wouldn't Wakonda be a leading world power? Why would it hide its superiority? That makes no sense.Bottom line is this is just more Marvel eye candy that has no depth.</review-text>

		<review-text>I'm not going to lie. I went into this movie totally expecting it to suck. I am a huge Superhero/Comic book fan but to be honest I never read any of the Black Panther comics or know anything about this Super hero. I first saw the panther appear in Captain America Civil war and I thought the hero was meh.. I jumped to the conclusion Black Panther is only getting his on movie because Marvel studios are trying to appear more inclusive and progressive and all that PC stuff lol. I couldn't be more wrong. They actually had a plan for this hero. Great back story, Fantastic visuals, great acting, totally hilarious, moving and poignant in parts, thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I really wasn't expecting the film to be this good. It felt like a cross between Coming to America and Thor. Go watch this film and I promise you wont be disappointed. All i can say is Wakanda forever!</review-text>

		<review-text>I was actually hoping to see a story of how T'Challa from his childhood could became the Black Panther. But it was not the case. And this was not a conventional Marvel movies either as usually origin story was made first before the superhero appeared in other movies. Regardless though, the story was made a bit short and went straight to the time when T'Challa would be made king. Plus the how he came to know Everett Ross was not shown which made me felt the movie was not too complete as an origin story. Other than those minor shortcomings that I personally felt, the movie definitely had some good moments. The action sequence in Korea plus the climax scene was awesome. The special effects (apart from few brief &quot;a bit obvious&quot; computerized scenes of Wakanda in the background during the time T'Challa was going to be crowned king) were very good. And there were also a bit of funny moments which involved Shuri plus surprisingly from M'Baku (Winston Duke).I would really advise you to be fully concentrated from the start to understand better on the earlier parts. To my personal opinion, the movie developed to be more interesting when the villains began to appear and the fights started.I get the appeal of this movie to critics due to its rather complex character development of T'Challa plus the appearance/representation of the African people in a world where third world country were still looked down. I myself as a simple minded movie audience preferred a more intense superhero movie, which I thought I did not really get in here. Therefore, even if the movie was hailed as one of the best in Marvel Cinematic Universe, I personally did not feel that. It may be good, but certainly not the best. Again this does not mean the movie was bad at all, even my wife was able to truly enjoy it. But as I felt it was not the best superhero origin movie &amp; the fact that the action sequence were not too much, I still prefer other such MCU movies like the first Iron Man, Ant-Man or Captain America. Oh another thing, there was not a lot of surprises here, even 1 or 2 supposed surprising moments could have been guessed by my wife and I. As usual, there would be end credit scene which was having 2 of them in this movie. So wait till the very end to make sure you see them. In conclusion, my personal view is that this movie was probably a little bit over-hyped.</review-text>

		<review-text>We all know that the MCU, more now than before, has been incredibly inclined towards humour, and in some of their installments have gotten it wrong; e.g. Age of Ultron and Ragnarok, however they've also gotten it right in other films such as Ant-Man and Homecoming. Black Panther, I'm so happy to say, falls firmly in the latter. The humour in this film is so well placed that I can't understand how MCU fails then, to consistently get it right, but I imagine it's all poised on who the director is. With that said, Black Panther is NOT perfect, it is very flawed, mainly due to one very major aspect.One thing Black Panther just got wrong, was Black Panther himself, and though it may be understandable is to how they made that mistake, as an MCU/comics/film fan, I can't ignore that fact/issue.Truthfully (and I hope you can try to appreciate this perspective), for these African cultures, unknown to the planet, to be put on the world stage in a positive light through such an established franchise on such a big scale for the very first time, is a moment both &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; America and the rest of the world can't fully imagine. Be African, in Africa and watch isiXhosa, a language spoken by millions in South Africa (a country, not an area) on global display, and then the Motlatsi, Sefate, Khotso and Morena (seSotho for King) apparel and heritage being put on the map, then watch Black Panther; it was sentimental, however, that was both a good thing, and a bad thing.Marvel Studios and Ryan Coogler didn't get the balance right. They focused way too much on portraying a culture and used the Black Panther as it's driving force, and thus neglected fleshing out Black Panther. So, Black Panther was illustrated during a celebration that wasn't necessarily part of the Black Panther arc. That was a major problem. Africa deserves to be recognized by the world, and doing it through Black Panther was right because of it's magnitude and inspiration, however was done wrong, because of the equilibrium.All that aside however, I absolutely loved the cast; notably Lupita Nyong'o and Angela Bassett,and specifically, Letitia Wright, Michael B. Jordan and Andy Serkis; they were just too amazing.The visuals were stunning, however the pacing was off from time to time. The score was pretty good, and the story was more than satisfactory while the script was crisp.Again, Black Panther is not perfect. Pacing, balancing and neglect issues, with an amazing cast that delivered on a solid script with stunning visuals made Black Panther a very enjoyable watch, with a side of; it could've easily been better. 7/10.</review-text>

		<review-text>I'm gonna have to go with the critics on this on this one, Black Panther was amazing! It wasn't completely flawless, but I will still give it a 10 star rating to balance the ratings a bit more. Honestly, I feel like the 1 star ratings are from people that didn't want to like the film from the start. There are barely any comedic jokes, the CGI was good (no CGI is absolutely perfect), the storyline was fantastic and the scenery was majestic. For those who were disappointed about the movie being boring, you shouldn't have expected a ton of action. Black Panther ORIGIN story is about his new responsibility, his ideals and Wakanda. He can go kick butt in the next Avengers film. Thoroughly enjoyed it and don't understand some hate.</review-text>

		<review-text>I've waited for this move since I first began collecting comic books over 30 years ago. A black super hero with a backstory.
The movie dragged and I became unamused that this seemingly futuristic society was relegated to solving its problem with black-on-black violence. 
The back story would have been better if it was not based on Anglo Christian shakesperean overtures. 
The message of embracing technology was welcome and the dream/visual of a home that could have been was overwhelming.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is directed by Ryan Coogler and stars a phenomonel cast that includes Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyongo, Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis and the list goes on. 
Set after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Prince T'Challa is about to be crowned king of Wakanda, but when a long buried secret is uncovered it threatens the country of Wakanda and the rest of the World! 
I really liked this film! And for a number of reasons. First of all this is a very well directed film made by the very talented director Ryan Coogler. The entire film feels original new and exciting thanks to his vision!
Whats also great about this is Wakanda it self. This beautiful land is so well realised on the screen. It serves as one of the most interesting locations in the MCU. 
What set Black Panther aside from the other Marvel films is it's great story that suprisingly tackles a lot of deep themes. 
All the actors are great in it, espescially Michal B. Jordan as the villain Killmongor. Killmongor is by far one of the best and most compelling MCU villains so far. His backstory and viewpoints are explored and you really get where he is comming from. However there was not quite enough of him. But whenever he is onscreen you are on the edge of your seat!
All these factors makes the film much more than just your average Marvel movie. It makes it into a film with a strong message and compelling characters. 
Black Panther is absolutely one of the best Marvel movies and highly recomended!
Final Rating 9/10</review-text>

		<review-text>The Marvel universe just keeps expanding here, in every good way. After Chadwick Boseman first appeared has the Black Panther in Captain America Civil War, you knew like Wonder Woman it would not be long before he would get his own movie. I heard back in the 90's they where trying to get a Black Panther movie in hopes it would starring Wesley Snipes in the title role, but it did not happen and Wesley Snipes went on to play another Marvel character known has Blade.
So how does this film hold up, I gotta say pretty well. Action scenes are pretty well done, like in any other superhero movie. Fight scenes are awesome to watch. And the effects are mind blowing. Chadwick Boseman gives a likable performance has the main character, I mean you really route for him all the way. Let's not forget Michael B. Jordan has the villain Killmonger, and the rest cast do well also. I'm looking forward for more Black Panther films in the future.</review-text>

Bravo.I am still processing. Some thoughts:*So many blurred lines between winners and losers.*An alternative title would be, &quot;Black Panther: Civil War&quot;*So sad seeing the Wakandans killing one another.*For all of the harm he does, Killmonger is more of an antagonist than a proper villain in the traditional sense.*His death was profound.

		<review-text>Greetings again from the darkness. Adaptations of Superheroes, Comic Books, and Graphic Novels have been driving the movie theatre box office for a few years now. Where the financial success of a film was once measured in tens of millions, it's now hundreds of millions. Beyond that, these enormous productions are pressured to make political and social statements ... providing the hope of which real life leaders seem to fail. This latest from Marvel and director Ryan Coogler (CREED, FRUITVALE STATION), carries all of that plus the expectations of an entire gender and race. It's a heavy burden for a comic book character, however it seems, regardless of one's perspective, it's likely the film delivers, satisfies, and ... oh yeah ... entertains.The bar has been set so high for action sequences and special effects, that we take the great for granted and only speak up on those that falter. What allows this film to take its place among the best of the genre is a combination of story depth and the payoff for showing us a world we haven't previously seen. The cultural aspects of the (mythical) African country of Wakanda are not only interesting, but the setting itself is breath-taking. An explosion of color, texture and technology blended with intriguing and multi-dimensional characters bring the film to life and draw us into this wonderland of tradition, culture and humanity.It seems ridiculous to speak of a comic book film in these terms, but the number of talking points raised during its runtime are too many and too varied to discuss in this format. What we can make clear is that it's cool to watch an entire movie where people of color and women are strong, confident, and intelligent. Chadwick Boseman has played Thurgood Marshall (MARSHALL), James Brown (GET ON UP), and Jackie Robinson (42), and here he takes on a fictional icon in King T'Challa/Black Panther. He perfectly captures the pensive nature of a King balancing tradition with the needs of his people to evolve and transition. His chief adversary &quot;Killmonger&quot; is played terrifically by Michael B Jordan (CREED, FRUITVALE STATION) as a man out for revenge and power. For most movies this head to head battle would be enough ... but not this time.Lupita Nyong'o (Oscar winner for 12 YEARS A SLAVE), Danai Gurira (&quot;The Walking Dead&quot;), and relative newcomer Letitia Wright play Nakia, Okoye, and Shuri respectively; a triumvirate of three of the strongest women you've likely ever seen on screen. Nakia is the love interest, but also carrying out her own humanitarian missions, while also proving to be beyond adequate as a soldier. Okoye is the ultimate warrior and absolutely loyal to her country, while Nakia (T'Challa's sister) is a contemporary version of James Bond's Q - the ultimate technology whiz, and one with the zippiest zingers. Any of these characters could be the basis for a standalone movie, but together they elevate this to something much more than a couple of dudes in sleek suits fighting.Martin Freeman (THE HOBBIT), Daniel Kaluuya (GET OUT), Sterling K Brown (&quot;This is Us&quot;), Angela Bassett, and Forest Whitaker are all contributors, and Andy Serkis is a frenzied standout in an all-too-brief turn as Klaue. The strong cast delivers even in the few moments when the script lags. In fact, the only piece of this puzzle that didn't seem to fit was the traditional hand-to-hand combat to determine the next king. Why is it that a nation so advanced still relies on primitive courses of decision-making? Perhaps this is merely commentary on our society, though providing a more intellectual solution would have been in line with the rest of the story.The world of Wakanda is stunning. The costumes are sleek, colorful and fascinating. The characters are multi-dimensional. The action sequences are top notch (armored rhinos!). The cinematographer is Rachel Morrison, who recently made history by being the first woman to receive an Oscar nomination for cinematography (MUDBOUND). It's these factors that allow Mr. Coogler's film to achieve the level of importance that most comic book films wouldn't dare to strive for. On top of everything, it accomplishes the one thing I demand from these type of movies ... it's quite fun to watch!</review-text>

		<review-text>Ryan Coogler has got to be one of the best directors out right now. Not only is his work phenomenal but his movies are cast to perfection. 
I think the phenomenal appeal of this movie, besides the fact that you can take your entire family because it's kid friendly, is that you don't have to be a comic book reader to follow the movie. It is good as a standalone, therefore you can take a date, you can take your parents, you can take your kids or you can take your comic book club.
I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it for all races and ages.</review-text>

		<review-text>Hail Wakanda! This has to be one of the best Marvel movies shown to date. First off, there is an actual coherent storyline. Basically, the movie is about inter-turmoil between Wakanda tribes on the subject of releasing their tech to the rest of the world. Some are against the idea as it will expose Wakanda to the world and some are all for it thinking it's for the greater good. The bad guy is pretty human by Marvel standards. In the end, he just wants to go home, gather his people and help save all the other oppressed people of the world. There is action but not as much as some people seem to like. There is no major alien/godly badguy to defeat. They are really just fighting themselves. The cast is colorful and you are not bombarded with stale jokes every frame (unlike Thor Ragnarok). I give this movie a solid 8 out of 10 stars. I do think the bad guy could have been a lot tougher to defeat and there were a few small items not clarified (So what do they do now that all the plants have been burned up?) but this was a pretty enjoyable flick</review-text>

		<review-text>So after reading many of the reviews on here I can simply describe some of them as &quot;hate&quot;. 
1) Politics, yes its political the main character is a king so to rule his kingdom politics has to be involved.
2) Its a Superhero movie you go into it KNOWING the good guy will survive in the end.
3) Yes the current climate in America takes a form in the movie, because the movie takes place present day and these are REAL problems that face many Americans.4)This is Marvel's best origin story followed closely by Iron Man and Ant Man. Since we were introduced to Black Panther in Civil War we finally get to see his homeland and how the Black Panther is chosen.5) I can't remember too many other Marvel films showing villain development the way this one does. We learn more about the villain in this movie (though briefly) we at least know the bad guy didn't just pop-up out of no where.6) There was plenty of action though the movie does have some slow parts, but so do a lot of movies.7) The comedic timing is great, not Deadpool level, but a little better than the other MCU movies.</review-text>

		<review-text>I've just seen one of the best ever movies in the MCU (In my opinion, it's the best) and came here only to be surprised with the overwhelming bad reviews. Something can't be right. Did I watch the wrong movie, or did you?Earlier this month we heard that a Facebook group called &quot;Down With Disney&quot; were planning to sabotage Black Panther's release by spamming rating sites (like IMDb) with negative reviews and ratings. You may have noticed that just three or four days ago (when IMDb first allowed Black Panther to be rated) the movie was sitting at a 6.6/10 with 3000 votes. As soon as release day came it shot up to a 7.7 (currently) and will probably keep rising. Nice try haters. Also, do you notice how most of the bad reviews are repetitive and are saying &quot;overrated&quot; and &quot;overhyped&quot;? Most people who are into the superhero genre will go see this regardless, but if you're sitting on the fence, please ignore the trolls.About the movie (Spoilers ahead):The Good:Visually stunning. I was a little depressed when the credits rolled. Wakanda takes you to a place you never want to leave.Strong supporting cast - in particular Killmonger, Shuri (T'Challa's younger sister), the beautiful Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) and badass female warrior Okoye. Good action scenes and fight choreographyGreat plot. Yes it's political, but why ignore the politics that made Wakanda so successful? It's a nation built on isolationism. Black Panther tackles politics head on by focusing on the cost and purpose of that isolation. Killmonger is an extremist, but his viewpoint is rooted in truth. To only take care of one's self and to turn a blind eye to those around you who need help, is ultimately cruel. The movie digs into these tough questions and I see nothing wrong with that. One of Marvel's best scores. I'm not referring to Kendrick Lamar's soundtrack, but the score itself was something special. Marvel have been lacking in that department for a while now. Especially in comparison to Hans Zimmer's work on DC movies.The not-so-good:CGI wasn't Marvel's finest. Especially during the final fight between Killmonger and T'Challa.It loses it's way a little after Killmonger takes the throne. It stops being about the challenges of leadership and more about &quot;stopping the bad guy&quot;. Predictable. T'Challa's death seemed like wasted time to me. We know he isn't dead, he's in Infinity War. So the whole mourning sequence wasn't needed, it carried no weight. We knew he was coming back for Killmonger, just didn't know how. Climatic battle between T'Challa and Killmonger should have been more personal. Instead it was two guys in nearly identical suits throwing each other about on train tracks. I did get a little emotional when Killmonger was dying and T'Challa brought him to see the sunset, but the fight preceding that could have been better.I can't think of too much more bad to say. To quote Entertainment Weekly:&quot;Ryan Coogler infuses nearly every frame with soul and style, and makes the radical case that a comic book movie can actually have something meaningful - beyond boom, kapow or America - to say. In that context, Panther's nuanced celebration of pride and identity and personal responsibility doesn't just feel like a fresh direction for the genre, it's the movie's own superpower.&quot;</review-text>

My Wife just loves to see him happy, and if she's happy, I'm happy.Personally, I was a bit taken aback by the ethnocentric themes of the movie. The nation of Wakanda seemed to have virtually no racial-diversity at all that I could see. Is that really such a wise thing to be encouraging these days?

		<review-text>It is not often that I take the time to write a review, but I believe for this movie it is in order. First, Black Panther as a character in the MCU has to be established in his position socially, politically, and globally - done, done and done. Second, the acknowledgement of T'Challa as a world force to be reckoned with is established in the context of his rule as King. For those who don't know, Black Panther/T'Challa is the only superhero who also is a head of state - this point is established solidly in his prior showing in Captain America: Civil War. Lastly, there is the ever looming conflict of how does a country engage the rest of the world when that world has shown hostility towards its potential advancement?
Those questions are established and debated strongly in this movie. While regarding the potentiality of development one African society could experience if never encroached upon by the outside world. Once again, the form and structure of the challenges for T'Challa and what he faces in overcoming these issues and shortcomings is established. Black Panther has to set the context of his story within his own domain, faced with having to overcome the habits of the past with the needs of the future. Black Panther sets up his further development into the MCU and the stories to come. What I respect about this film is despite it being fictional, it gives dignity to the issues Africa has faced from the 15th century unto present day. It approaches the issues of African vs African Americans and people who are considered the Third World, and the true misnomer it must be in regard to a society left to grow untouched by the outside world.
It tackles the homecoming aspect of African peoples reaching out to its descendants and antecedents. Black Panther covers an extraordinary amount of ground, establishing traditions, rites of ascension, acknowledgement of duty above personal interest or belief, understanding of community interest over individual interest. Ryan Coogler does an excellent job in the co-writing on this movie to set the tone for a character whose challenges are not only individual but global, socio-political, and scientific. I give this movie a 10/10 because if you understand the history, and how it is referenced and addressed, the MCU and Marvel Studios does not fail to pay respects not only to a challenging character to portray, but to ensure it pays respect to the cultural heritage which it is connected to. Black Panther is a broader character whose powers are not simply attached to his individual perspective on right and wrong, or good over evil, but the management of those powers in the protection of an entire nation and its diverse peoples (use, diverse - 5 tribes who warred, but established peace and established Wakanda). All in all, the powerful, and human figures. The dry and focused humor which are natural in such situations. Furthermore, the well defined personal values of beauty and power (especially amongst the Dora Milaje), and men who say what they mean, and mean what they say having the restraint to know how to excercise such power.
Go see Black Panther - judge for yourself, and before you decide it's not your typical MCU movie - That's the point, he's not your typical Marvel character. Enjoy!</review-text>

		<review-text>This movies production is a merger of South Korea, Georgia (USA) and Australia. I have never read the comic books but this movie is very well done. The locations, the cast, and the production between Marvel, Disney, and Lucas Films is once again film magic.The Scenery is astounding, the special effect are right on, and most importantly the script is excellent giving the actors room to act and they do it so well. One of the Script Writers, is also the director(Ryan Coogler) of the film Creed. There are a couple members of the cast from that film too. The costumes are amazing, and the sound track is spot on. The theme of unity at the end is a good message. The film length at slightly over 2 hours is about right. As far as the entertainment, well Stan Lee is definitely holding on here for safe keeping. Andy Serkis from the Apes movie series is Ulysses Klaue, and though his role is cut short, he plays him to the hilt. Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan head up a talented cast. The ladies including Lupita Nyong (Star Wars-The Force Awakens) do not by any stretch take a back seat to the male cast.There's so much action, it is very nearly the end of the film before there is any romance. By the time the films kisses come, well, the credits roll shortly after. There's lots of crudos to go around on this movie. Martin Freeman (The Hobbit) is Everett K Ross, a former pilot and CIA agent whose nowhere near being in charge in this film. Letitia Wright as Shuri stands out.As usual, wait and watch the credits for some surprises, and to applaud an excellent cast and crew put together to make this one.</review-text>

		<review-text>As a comic book movie, Black Panther represents a rare feat - something that stands on its own without franchise tie-ins or guest heroes, something that works as both drama and adventure without going too dark, something that manages to be about something without ever slowing down. I could have complained about the plot's predictability...but I was too damn busy enjoying it. As a social moment, Black Panther represents something pretty unique too. Not to overstate things, but I have literally never been to a movie theater with this much palpable energy and anticipation. The whole place was ready and waiting for a different kind of superhero movie. But even with ALL the hype, the movie managed to surpass expectations. Put simply: this film was special.</review-text>
		<review-title>A great comic book movie, and a great movie period.</review-title>

		<review-text>I had a small window of an opportunity to go see this movie opening day between things I had to do, and I'm glad I did. That's saying a lot from someone who's used to routines throughout the week.
They pack a lot into this chapter for the panther. I haven't taken the time to actually research the comic book character. Thankfully, there's plenty of exposition at the beginning, which is a good thing considering that there has been plenty of hype for each Marvel movie that comes out. It really helps the audience because this day in age, most people won't bother to do any research. For some movies, yes, you should get on Wikipedia or YouTube the character and see what pops up.
There's a lot that Black Panther is, and there's a lot that it isn't in the way of comic book adaptions. Marvel is getting better and better at keeping the superheroes fresh for the intended audience. The problem with DC is the way they've been handling their superheroes, but that's a whole different topic.
Yes, this is a bit of a political storyline, but at the same time the political side of the movie thankfully doesn't overpower the rest of it. There's plenty of action, ripped guys w their shirts off for the girls to leak their hormones all over, plenty of comedic moments and everything else in between. Martin Freeman's character is rather left hanging on as the comedic role, considering he's done this before w The Hobbit trilogy. 
As far as the culture of Wakanda, it's a mix between Iron Man's work and something you might see in Bruce Wayne's Bat-cave. Several parts made me think they could've used some of this technology in The Dark Knight trilogy. That is one impressive cave the panther has. The only thing that really stood out to me that was different was seeing that one guy who had that ornamental piece attached to his lip, ;-)
I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I've learned to stop reading reviews and what critics are saying about movies today because all they ever do anymore is shred the filmmakers to pieces. I want to be entertained, not to go into a theater to judge a movie. The rare exception would be sitting down to some Batman movie that would be similar to Batman &amp; Robin. I'm a huge Bat-fan.
Well, I certainly enjoyed this entry in the MCU. Would probably get it when it's out on home video, or available for streaming off Amazon.</review-text>

		<review-text>Wow! What an amazing film! Just everything; from the story, to the acting,
the cinematogrophy, the camerawork, the special effects.. everything felt like
a beautiful piece of art.Acting 10/10: The cast does an amazing job doing their roles. Michael B. Jordan.. I cant say enough good things about this character. He's relatable, yet so so menacing... an actual threat for not T'challa or the world perse, but the goal of T'challa.. to his actual legacy. The women were amazing and empowering, showing they can also love and choose to be warriors(not because they cant come out of wakanda.........). Cinematogrophy/VFX 9/10: Beautiful. Seriously beautiful. There are some iffy moments in the action scenes especially at the end were every tiny detail is CGI. The movements are very gracious and quick, which make for wonky image sometimes. Story 10/10: This story is AIRTIGHT. For me it was kind of a perfect. Everything wove in perfectly. Every storybit had a pay off. The scenes served the story and not the other way around, which results in a rewarding film and is very rare. I think I only saw that in maybe civil war, winter soldier and the dark knight. All in All, I cant stop loving this film. It is perfect for me. Yes I complained about the wonky CGI sometimes, but thats because you can't have zero negatives in a review right? I would give it a 10/10,, because i will watch it much more in the theatres.</review-text>

		<review-text>I saw Black Panther today and I came out happy. It had a really nice story with a lot of heart and overall gave us a new experience. 
The whole cast was great and thanks to them and the directing team they have made a very good addition to the Marvel family. 
Fight scenes were pretty and the combination of technology was very cool.I did feel it jumped a bit too much in certain scenes.
However I was worried, I found that recent Marvel films like Thor tried to hard to give us a comedy and failed with other emotions. 
Spiderman homecoming was good but for me it had a few issues like every character had to be funny except Spiderman and he suddenly lost his ability to use his suit despite being incredible in Civil War. But I came out surprised and happy with Black Panther! So overall I am giving it an 8 
The reason I didnt give it a 7 is because this is the last film before Infinity Wars so the Hype is at a new level!!!!Hope you enjoy this honest review 
Enjoy Black Panther And most importantly enjoy Infinity Wars!</review-text>

		<review-text>I was honored to receive an invite to attend an advanced screening of Marvel's latest release, &quot;Black Panther&quot;. I will be honest I didn't know a lot about this character before reading about him recently and seeing the film. The story line crosses both racial and cultural lines which has made this super hero a fan favorite for more than 50 years and I really love him now too. He is a fierce fighter and is empathetic to those around him. He has a big heart and wants to do his very best.T'Challa is haunted by the mistakes of his father and is also a flawed person but puts a lot of pressure on himself to be the best king he can be for his people. During his transformation to King he goes to the land of his ancestors and is able to have a brief talk with his father. His father assures him he will be a good king but it will be hard because he has a good heart. This is a weakness and something he has to figure out how to balance with his leadership and superhero roles. I really enjoyed watching Mr. Boseman as this character and he brought not only a fierceness to the role but also a sensitivity and a humor that was just so human and optimistic. Things might be hard but he tried to come with an openness and we saw more of that come to fruition as the movie progressed.I loved the entire cast of this movie and felt like the right people were put into the right roles. I can't imagine anyone else playing these characters. The performances were incredibly strong although I definitely felt like Shuri, T'Challa's sister played by Letitia Wright, stole the show. I just loved her character! She was strong, funny and intelligent. She is the force behind inventing much of the Wakandan modern technology (if this was Bond, she would be Q) and most specifically the Black Panther suit. On top of all that, she is a character girls are going to look to and be inspired by. I really loved the chemistry between all of the characters and felt like they genuinely liked or loved each other. It didn't feel forced.I felt like the action really kept in line with what is shown in other Marvel movies. In fact I felt like there was less fighting and violence in this film than in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; and some of the other Marvel Studios films. There is sword play and a couple of scenes using guns but the most dramatic fight scenes are hand to hand battles for the throne.After seeing this movie I couldn't help thinking back to last year and seeing the new &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;. Seeing a woman yield such incredible power, yet being allowed to also be tender, hit me so hard. I walked away from Black Panther with the same feeling I had with &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;. Seeing fierce, powerful, intelligent, tender women standing up and being a part of the action spoke to me and I cheered for them every time they picked up a spear or showed the technology they created or acted as advisers. I really liked that the women were treated as equals. There was equal &quot;saving of each other&quot;, never portraying the women as weaker and needing help. They worked together. This spoke to the message at the end of the film that we all need to learn that we are one tribe on this earth and we all need to look out for each other. We highly recommend the film!</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther was super cool. The actor who plays the lead does a great job. The unique sets and costumes of Wakanda were a treasure and hopefully we get a lot more major motion pictures with diverse cultures that can fill the screen.The film has a great moral dilemma about how a king from a wealthy African nation faces his inner demons when he deals with a deadly relative who has been subjected to the abuses his people face in the western world. The Black Panther costume is great, too. Another Marvel masterpiece! Worth seeing in 3D or IMAX.</review-text>

		<review-text>I'm a general Marvel fan, but even this blew my expectations away! I had my doubts as I saw the insanely-high Metacritic rating, but all of my fears were proven wrong when I attended a special screening of it. The action, cinematography and effects are great as usual, but it also has something many Marvel critics beg for: a right mix of humor, story, dark tone, and character. It doesn't rely on huge doses of humor as an excuse to cover it's story (like Thor Ragnarok, as much as I liked that), but instead gives each and every character a chance to grow and mature for us to care about. The story also has many interesting themes and twists, as does the social commentary about race. My only complaint was a few wonky CGI moments and an underwhelming villain, but otherwise Black Panther had enough to offer for anyone of any age to enjoy. Finally, an action movie with substance! 9.5/10</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther...WOW. What can I say? It's just a fantastic movie that finally showcases a demographic that have been CLAMORING for a flick showing positive imagery for A LONG TIME. Basically we've been waiting FOREVER and a DAY, for a serious Black Superhero with excellent supporting cast, and magnificent writing from a black man/crew. In a word the movie was STUPENDOUS. It was great seeing Black people portrayed in every way possible in one film. Whether they were the warrior, the villain, the usurper, the tech-wizard, the King, etc. it was fantastic to see this many black people in a movie that doesn't have to do with slavery, or drug-running, or ghettos, or ratchet behavior. A superhero film portraying a black person in a black setting, with positive imagery ... it was worth the wait.I love every moment of this movie. On criticism though - I actually wish it was a little bit longer. Like around 25 minutes longer. A couple more fight scenes and more background on other character would have been nice, but otherwise it was an almost perfect movie! Go and see it ASAP, truth knows no colour!!</review-text>

		<review-text>Its not often a movie lives up to its hype. Black Panther does. It may even exceed its hype. It certainly surpassed my expectations.For anyone complaining about the movies &quot;politics&quot; - How do you tell a story about a king and not have politics enter into it? There are three possibilities. 1) The complainers have never seen another Marvel Movie. 2) They aren't perceptive enough to recognize politics in most movies or 3) their racism is showing.This was the best superhero movie I've seen and I've seen almost all of them. It had an origin story with roots that run deep into a rich mythology. It wove in a contemporary and relevant theme and the players, hero and villain alike were human in the best and worst ways.The writing was solid and thoughtful. Superhero movies so often fall to employing A deus ex machina in the end or otherwise insult the audiences' intelligence. Black Panther did neither. It told a solid story with good action and left you with a sense of hope in the end. Thoroughly enjoyable. I hope to see it in the theater again. I will definitely add it to my collection.</review-text>

		<review-text>The pinned under the rubbles in Homecoming, Logan and Watchmen entire movie.
Those were emotional, but didn't make me cry.
But the relationship between T'Challa and Erik with their respective father made me cry.Among superhero movies I've watched, this is the best so farThe score for the reviews and ratings for this movie is kinda funky.
Just like Get Out, there are people that rated this too high or too low due to racial issue.
I say let's put that aside and judge this movie for it's quality as a movie.
Even the final message expressed by this movie, as said by T'Challa, is to build bridges to connect, help, and work together with everyone.But I digress,
Worthy of it's title as the best superhero movie so far (according to me), the actions, visual effects, and scale were amazing.
The music matches the tone of the scenes and overall enjoyable.The enemies are not &quot;faceless&quot; like Ultron's robots, Avenger's aliens, Suicide Squad's and Justice League's Dumb Whatever-Those-Things are, and this is my favorite aspect of the movie, actual enemies with personalities and ideas.The only &quot;flaws&quot; (not really but) to me are :
1. The villains were as interesting as Loki, but they were all dead. Pity.
2. Despite being a superhero movie, not much &quot;superheroing&quot; done. Well, this is the internal strife part so understandable.In conclusion : Watch it</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther was awesome and the triumphant king of Wakanda. First thing first, I enjoy and loved the film as it stands out on its own. Plus the world building of MCU, now were introduced to the world of Wakanda, were technology is advanced by a few decades than everywhere else around the world. But it is also kept a secret except for the people from Wakanda. It was beautiful visually; it had some good action sequences, and an inspirational plot. I will throw this out there, I feel like the movie is overhyped. It was a great movie. But when you put this up with other Marvel films. There are other great ones and better superhero movies than this. The pros about this film. Lets start with the plot. It does not feel like a Marvel movie at all. It is a good thing. It starts after the events of Captain America Civil War. T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) heads back to Wakanda. He is declared King. When he sees that Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) shows up on the radar selling vibranium that only belongs to Wakanda. And the rest of the world is not ready for this technology. T'Challa chases Klaue down and discover a mercenary Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) may be his biggest challenge yet. When Killmonger wants to take over Wakanda. Plot is inspirational, about a king that does not think he is ready. But is faced with an ultimate challenge politically when he wants to do what is right for his kingdom and the rest of the world. The action sequences were good. May not be an action packed wild ride compared to other marvel movies. I ll be honest about the opening action scene was terribly lighted and dark and filled with close up camera shots and quick editing. When Black Panther attacks a convoy to rescue one of the hostages. But it gets better throughout. It has a few good action scenes. From the casino when T'Challa and Okoye (Danai Gurira) fight through some bad guys. To a car chase scene with Black Panther. And than a climatic battle Killmonger's followers and a fight between him and Panther on a futuristic railway. Director Ryan Coogler could have made some action scenes fun. When offered a 200 million budget. He really tried to be careful to not over do it. But he could have tried for a blockbuster approach. The visual effects were great. The music score stands out on its own as a MCU film with an electronic chant music. Chadwick Boseman was great as Panther/T'Challa. Michael B. Jordan was also good. And stands out as a villain. When his motivation is slowly revealed after a tragic past that made him what he is today. Lupita Nyong as Nakia was great as T'Challa's love interest and wants to do something about the real world's conflict outside Wakanda. Danai Gurira has a lot more screen time and is good too. Same with Martin Freeman, who has more to do than his brief appearance in Captain America. And Letitia Wright as Shuri was great as T'Challa's sister and is the brains in offering new technology and gadgets. Overall, Black Panther is a great film. I loved it. It is visually entertaining. The action was not top notch but it was good. The plot was great, it was a little too much in the political side than being a personal character story, and the huge cast ensemble was good. If the movie were standing alone as a superhero it would have been the best movie. But being part of the MCU, there are other great movies better than this. I feel like this film was lacking in the fun energy than the last several MCU films had. I still recommend seeing this film in theatres for its exciting action, an indifferent plot, and also there is two post credit scenes, I think the final end scene was a nice nod to a character. I rate the film 5 out of 5 stars.</review-text>
		<review-title>Its too overhyped as a MCU movie. But still a great exciting adventure for the Black Panther character.</review-title>
	</review>
	<review id="308">
		<review-text>I have seen a lot of reviews on here about how the plot is lackluster and the acting is bad. I do not think that either of these things is true.While I do see how some would see the plot, specifically Erik Killmonger's motives, as being heavy-handed; I think the statement about colonialism is powerful. Killmonger's suggestions, up until his final verdict about how to deal with his anti-colonialism, are all very valid even if they are shrouded in anger. He has a right to be angry, and as an audience you realize this.T'Challa on the other hand is affected deeply by Killmonger's words and actions, and while he does not see his violent resolve as a helpful means of reparations, he still empathizes. By the end of the movie I feel as if T'Challa is different morally and changed very dramatically in a plethora of ways. To go further, the entirety of Wakanda is changed forever. They open themselves to the world in an attempt to help others who are underprivileged or disadvantaged. All of the characters, lead or otherwise, change throughout the movie. It is refreshing to actively see change based on experience, especially in a solo MCU movie. And, it adds a new perspective to T'Challa specifically.Basically, Black Panther was entertaining, the fight scenes were good, character development was good too. That being said, some CGI felt unfinished and some writing not edited well enough. This movie is not perfect, and it had its thematic and cinematic (visual) faults, but it was refreshing to see such great representation without it feeling forced or butchered. Worth the watch.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is it. The last step. It should be clear for anybody, that so-called &quot;professional critics&quot;, that are praising this movie as a masterpiece of sorts, a New Testament for a certain group of people, the best movie of all time are, in fact, fake. Maybe they were paid off, maybe afraid to tell the truth about &quot;first black superhero movie&quot; (also a fake - we remember Blade, and Blade is, indeed, a Marvel superhero) - but the results are devastating.Marketing guys decided to play the race card and they've collected the prize during the first weekend. But the long-running consequences for future Marvel films and &quot;professional reviewers&quot; will be far more worst - people will not buy their shit.This movie is ripped from Lion King along with dozen of other films (James Bond and Rocky Balboa, for e.g.), refreshed with bad CGI and questionable soundtrack. Really, the final battle looks like a shortcut scene from some mediocre video game - press X to win.Coogler done the impossible -T'Challa, along with his girlfriend, are less interesting interesting characters, like Everett Ross. Only this fact indicates the quality of the directing and acting.Literally, this movie should be called &quot;Killmonger&quot; and centered about Michael B.Jordan character - definitely, he has potential and Coogler knows, how to handle the actor and boost his performance. But Jordan has less screen time, then he deserves, and this fact flattened down the character to some stupid angry kid with world domination ambitions. Nobody, for some reason, reminded him, that truly free person does not want to own slaves. We again have the antagonist, that have similar powers with protagonist. We again have a couple between main hero &amp; Lupita's character with zero chemistry between them. Seriously, interaction between BP &amp; his sister are much more enjoyable. Looks like Shuri will be next Iron Maiden.We have a carefully calculated cast: a couple of Oscar-worthy performers, a bunch of strong women to satisfy feminists (no gays for some reason, definitely the way to improve!), rising stars and two white men just to shut up rumors about &quot;all-black, anti-white film&quot;. Filmmakers were so scared to offend someone, that character Man-Ape was referenced only by name (M'Baku) and was portrayed without his iconic ape suit.We have a future-tech, rich and powerful hidden country, where king is being selected in a direct battle. Trump vs Clinton! Who wins? A small country silently decides to take the whole world just because a random guy with royal blood appeared from nowhere and ordered this monstrosity, only a small amount of rebels does not agree. Of course, other countries does not have intelligence agencies, atomic bombs and all word population can be controlled by Wakandians, especially ex-USSR, Arabic World, China, India and Asia. Civil war with blades and spears? Without beam / projectile weapons? No, we have BATTLE RHINOS! Too many plot holes and assumptions - even for a comic book movie.Two white guys - Lee and Kirby - invented the character long ago. Right now Coogler and Marvel missed the opportunity to present a really fresh, interesting story involving Black Panther - this is really sad, I was hoping (after Civil War) to see a movie without dozens of cliches and copypaste work. No mentions of MLK, Malcom X, real Black Panthers? Seriously, guys, this is not good at all. Real world is struggling to live in peace, internal conflicts are loud and clear - and You've left us with another lunatic, who wants to rule the world.</review-text>

I would have been happy with them dialling back the action / CGI battles if they had replaced it with a gripping story and some strong character development, but what we got instead was neither.I'm probably being a little harsh, but after all the hype and incredible reviews it received, plus Black Panther's fantastic entry into the MCU in Civil War, I was left feeling sorely disappointed.

		<review-text>Did you ever see that movie Troy from 2004? (or maybe 2003 or 2005. . sometime around then).
This movie is exactly the same. People fighting with killing to be the one in charge with a hot, sexy man walking around shirtless the whole time.
I don't even understand how this constitutes as a super hero movie, because he wasn't walking around saving people in distress from crime in the middle of the night or nothing.
Nothing really happens in the movie. It's a lot of mindless violence. People get killed for no reason. People kill people without thinking twice and with no remorse. A lot of people brought their little kids to see this movie of violent slayings
And sex god, Chadwick Boseman, is shirtless for most of the movie, which is why I bumped it up from 1 star to 3. Because I like myself some eye candy.
I should probably just stop seeing anything by Disney altogether, because I was born in the 1980s, and I don't think I ever seen anything Disney that wasn't a remake of something else, or based on old fairy tales, or comics that were already tv shows in the 1960s.</review-text>

		<review-text>First off, really enjoyed it and so did my little boy (12). There were some great characters fleshed out really well with a great cast, plenty of standard comic book action and some funny banter/quips between characters which never felt out of place (T'Challa and his sisters banter is really enjoyable).Even though there's a lot of technology on show the films never feels too &quot;techie&quot; and, at it's heart, it keeps grounded and true to it's tribal kingdom roots. The main arc T'Challa character arc of taking on the Black Panther/King mantel, the tribes and storyline around that is really well done.Outside that there are some regulation car chases, shoot-outs, fights, etc which are pretty standard Marvel fare and nothing great. They look good (obviously) but are a little OTT and distracting from the well acted, grounded plotlines. There's also the annoyance of the overacting, ham-master himself Andy Serkis.All-in-all, it's a very solid comic book movie with some great sections (see above re: grounded, realistic story bits) and some decent standard Marvel schlock. Better than most Marvel movies it's fare to say, and yes it does have a great cast too!Definitely worth watching but not, as some have said, a 97% hit or as good as the critics are trying to have you believe (I assume that's more a case of pushing it's first black superhero thing - Blade might not have been the first but it wasn't that long ago, was it!?!?)</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is a good movie, but not a great movie. The central portion of the film is really good and the characters are all engaging while the villain delivers motivations above and beyond the usual Hollywood standard.The problems I found with Black Panther really only came at the beginning and end of the story. For me it took quite a while for the story to actually get going (not till Michael Jordan's character shows up in Korea does the the story really start to pick up pace) though as they were establishing both the characters and setting this is perhaps understandable and I would expect this not to be such an issue in subsequent films. The ending I found a little rushed by contrast and wish they had spent slightly less time on the set up and more time on the pay off.The other major problem I found were with the fight scenes, which I found slightly repetitive; the 'challenge' scenes were quite well done however the confrontation between the hero and villain at the end felt underwhelming, certainly when compared with the rest of the battle taking place elsewhere, that however is not uncommon in Marvel films.Overall well worth seeing and I look forward to more Black Panther films.</review-text>

		<review-text>Sit through the first half hour and you are duly rewarded. There's a lot about the MCU from a scriptwriting standpoint I couldn't stand, but this and Ragnarok prove that we are thankfully far away from the days of Iron Man 2 and Captain America 1. Black Panther is so much more thematically dense, rich and driving that many others in the franchise, and unlike Ragnarok, the emotional conflict drives the core physical conflict that is the cause of all the explosive action scenes. The film does not shy away from the obvious political bent; the dying lines of the villain lean so hard into the theme of oppression vs. the potential/imperative to improve upon it that I almost can't believe the soulless heads driving the Marvel project let them get away with it.But you have to make it to the Forest Whitaker exposition scene around the midpoint. Until then, Black Panther doesn't feel like it has much of a story. The first act is all set-up with one action scene and not a particularly great one at that, and with only three more big setpieces to follow it doesn't actually get to show off the Black Panther toolkit much at all, even with all the Chekhov's Guns going off in just the right places. So while I think this is one of the best Marvel movies from an artistic standpoint, there are others, like both Guardians and Ragnarok, that are better paced, better delivered movies.</review-text>

Second Film of Choice at tHe Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Black Panther. Time for another Marvel production. This was not your usual Marvel film. However it was fabulous. What made this one different is we were not bombarded with lots of superhero stuff this was more a tale of sci-fi folklore which erupted from a hidden city in the depths of Africa onto the rest of the world. This was a tale of who wins the throne and who is worthy to carry on the name and the work of Black Panther. There was much solemnity in this film interspersed with irreverence at solemn moments which elicited burst of laughter from the audience. Although slow it parts I felt this was necessary to the storyline and kudos must be given to the model makers and animators for creating a city fitting of both a metropolitan situation and an African savannah. Great use of rhinos, and some rather fancy intense battle scenes. I like the panther suit and the technology which comes with it. It was a little like watching Q from James Bond with all his gadgets, only way cooler. Although very different from the usual Marvel film I do feel this slots neatly into its place in the franchise. Once again people.......don't leave before the end of the credits.....two extras this time!!!!</review-text>

		<review-text>To be honest, this movie was not the greatest. I have seen much better from Marvel in the past. I came to the theater to watch this movie and be impressed by yet another one of Marvel's great masterpieces. Sadly, I was let down by this mess. Mostly all of the fighting/action scenes were very dark and hard to see. It ruined the whole part of this movie being an action movie. Like, if this was going to be an action movie, they could've at least shown some of the action scenes better than they did. You could hardly see anything. Also, the plot was really short. Why fit such a short plot into a 2 hour 15 minute movie? That's just not right. There just wasn't really enough things going on to successfully make this movie fit right and fulfill the time this movie was. However, Marvel did manage to make a pretty OK and average movie. It had a few good plot twists and I thought the acting was actually pretty good, (despite what others think.) Although the comedy wasn't the best compared to the other Marvel movies we've seen in the past, it was again pretty average.And, it's not like it really tortured me to sit through this movie. I pretty much enjoyed it 70% of the time, and my little sister and parents liked it, too. 7/10. A sadly average movie for Marvel. Hope &quot;Avengers: Infinity War&quot; works out better for them. &quot;Black Panther&quot; didn't really do much for anyone.</review-text>

		<review-text>Took a few days to mull this review over. Visually this as impressive as a Marvel title gets, Wakanda brought to ife and it's beautiful. The let down is the somewhat predictable plot, as the early part of the film plays out it was easy to see how the end was to play out.This in mind the there is a lot packed into the 2hr 15 runtime, which oddly with the story, you find some parts seem drawn a little too much, leaving the final act far too predicatble and extremley busy.The casting is good and Michael B Jordan in particular impressive.It will be interesting to see further development of Black Panther.</review-text>

		<review-text>Marvel took a huge risk with black panther just before the release of The Infinity Wars. With a complete different tone as compared to other
marvel movies, the risk may not have paid off and it could have affected the frenzy around the final two movies with box office not performing
as expected. But, the movie turned out to be brilliant and Marvel continues to outperform DC on all levels (JL was a disappointment).
I think Marvel's formula for success is to have atleast a decent story line, like the trunk of a tree, rather than going all bang bang with
expensive grpahics. Then characters are introduced and developed just like branches of a tree over time. There are as many as nine diverse characters and
all of them are given sufficient screen time. The setting is similar to background where the tree (analogy) is growing. The set here is Wakanda.
The designers have done a marvellous job with the city, costume, and make up. The soundtracks bring an element of Africa beautifully binding Wakanda
and the characters. The dialogues are decent with tinge of humour and smartass lines.
Black panther (without revealing any spoilers) is a story of a prince who rights the wrong of his father in light of his death. TChaka created
the monster killmonger due to differences in ideology with his cousin. Klaue is another interesting character who smuggles vibranium out of Wakanda
and is responsible for death of Tchaka and other tribe leaders. TChalla is looking to avenge his father's death when he encounters Killmonger and loses
control over Wakanda in a straight duel to the throne with him. With help from Jabari tribe, Nakia, and Shuri; TChalla manages to defeat Killmonger and
brings about few changes for the first time as a ruler of Wakanda.
Now, coming to the ratings of the movie, there are five parameters on which I score movie out of ten. These are story (1), acting (1.5), aesthetics (2),
editing/narrating (1.5), Xfactor/uniqueness/fun (1.3) which totals to 7.3/10. My reccommendation is MUST WATCH.
I like to end my reviews by describing my favourite scene of the movie. Mine is- the car chase scene in which Klaue tries to escape and TChalla 
dismantles vehicles like toys by jumping over them and removing wheels with one hand.</review-text>

		<review-text>It definitely is wonderful to see a big blockbuster film like this have a majority black led cast and not have the focus be on their oppression. Not that stories of slavery, racism &amp; police brutality aren't important, but I think its important for little black kids to see themselves as Kings or Queens too, who also are self sufficient. So I hope this movie does trigger Hollywood to do more movies in a similar vein. Now with that aside, how does fall within the MCU for me? Overall, I enjoyed it. Though to be fair, there hasn't been a movie yet that I have really hated, a few that Ive been a bit disappointed by thats it. Im still re-evaluating my current standings (so this may change), but I think this is likely around the 5th best movie for me. There is a lot of stuff that is great. In particular I really liked Letitia Wright as Shuri. There's just such a brightness to her. She's incredibly delightful, smart, funny and gets to kick some ass too. Killmonger is a great villain. Hes not just lame villain the hero fights in the 3rd act and is defeated after 10 minutes. He has a presence throughout. He's also such a genuinely dark character who will literally kill whoever's in his path with little to no remorse. He'll blind side and double cross you if he gets the chance. I also thought Klaue was a lot of fun. Yes, he's a bad guy, but he's just crazy, chaotic kind of kooky and Andy Serkis breathes some life into him. There are also some gorgeous costumes and sets. A couple of funny lines here and there (my favourite was the vegetarian line) but it definitely doesnt focus on that too much. There were things I disliked or am nit-picky about. I eye-rolled so hard at the &quot;What are those&quot; line. Its a dated vine/meme/whatever. It was never that funny to begin with and feels like a cheap gag to get some kids in the theater to laugh. I didn't buy into Daniel Kaluuya's character motivations. There is that line about how Klaue killed his parents, so I understand he wants them dead, but it just doesnt seem believable how easily he turned on T'Challa. Also in accordance with his character, him and Danai Gurira are supposed to be in a relationship and yet we barely get any interaction between the two. I think the height of their interaction is calling each other &quot;My Love&quot;. I assume they added it in because they wanted to add some stakes when his character supports Killmonger, but I didnt think it added anything. Im not saying we had to devote a 30 minute subplot to their romance, but a few more moments here and there may have helped to solidify them as a couple and make you care a little bit more later on in the film when you see them on opposite sides of the battlefield. Also, I dont understand how Angela Bassets hair SUDDENLY turns white. So yeah, a couple of grievances that stopped me from fully enjoying my experience, but overall a lot of stuff to like as well. I think if you're a fan of the MCU you'll like this one too.</review-text>

		<review-text>I was actually quite surprised to see the immense hype surrounding this film. Part of me was like, yes its a Marvel Cinematic Universe film so it'll be big. The other part was like wow this is blowing away the box office and is quite the phenomenon. The final stop before Avengers: Infinity Wars so of course I was ready for it. The introduction of Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War was one of the highlights of a super hero studded action blast. Overall, I quite liked what I saw here. Its not mind blowing and nowhere near the best the MCU has had to offer, but its a welcome addition to the Universe and is a good vehicle stand alone for a superhero who deserves it.The film takes place slightly after the death of T'Chaka, and T'Challa (his son) becoming the new King of Wakanda and becoming the new Black Panther. Wakanda is a nation that seems third world to outsiders but the nation is actually thriving in science and technology because of its abundance of vibranium. However, outside forces are made aware of this and T'Challa's throne and kingship is challenged. The film has an absolutely wonderful cast at its helm. Boseman, Jordan, Nyong'o, Kaluuya, to name a few. Visually, I think this film is on par with the best Marvel has to offer. The futuristic and scenic display of Wakanda just pop on to the screen. Boseman does well as a soft spoken yet unmistakable leader of his kingdom. I really like the Michael B. Jordan and Ryan Coogler collaboration and it works once again here. Killmonger is a good villain and its easy to rate him highly among the other MCU villains we have seen. Letitia Wright is also a real highlight of the film and likely has a bright future ahead of her.Something else that really sticks out for me is the costume design in the film. Black Panther probably has the sleekest and best looking suit in the Marvel film universe. Add to that the suits capabilities. That whole absorb kinetic energy only to redeliver it moments later onto foes is so cool. A lot of the lore of what is capable in Wakanda with vibranium is really eye catching and does well to add to the mystique of the nation.Some of the film feels formulaic though. Also, there aren't many gripping shocking moments, as the films plot unfolds into a predictable place. The action set pieces are quite nice, although the final battle is a tad bit disappointing. The mix of traditional African music and modern hip hop for the soundtrack/score was a bit off putting as well. I don't have that many complaints about the film but its also missing a bit of the awe factor that other films like Thor: Ragnarok and Civil War were able to bring.All in all, I'm glad a lot of people have been praising Black Panther and have felt really inspired by an African hero. I have to say though I think its not in that upper echelon of Marvel films, but is still quite a respectable entry into the Universe. I'm ready to see Black Panther and his Wakandan allies in the Infinity Wars. Ryan Coogler is officially three for three in solid films. Pretty content with this film.7/10</review-text>

		<review-text>This is my first ever movie review which in my mind justifies my rating! I will start off with all the things I liked about the movie and then explain why I feel like I am overrating it. Hands down my favorite ingredient is the sci-fi. I loved how the rare earth metal was weaved into the story and allowed amazing technological innovations. The costumes are excellent!The dialogue is excellent, contemporary, serious, witty, and funny.The cause of the superhero's action and emergence is compelling, believable, and easily relatable.Now the negative. I could easily have given this a 4-5 rating. I literally dozed off several times at some of the more redundant parts of the movie. It was so predictable where this was going and it just dragged on and on and on. Even tho I liked the dialogue a lot, I want there to be a point to it. The story telling left no drama or suspense for what I should expect. The theme of a hidden technological city was tragically ignored after the opening few scenes. It felt like the movie abandoned the concept of any sort of interaction between this city and the outside world. I get that that was kind of the moral point of the movie, but the point was almost completely missed by me until the after credit scene. The beginning and endings were memorable to me, but the entire struggle between the villain and hero left so much to be desired. I was just extremely bored with the plot. I felt like I was sitting around for the entire movie waiting for a spark to ignite my imagination. I give it 5 based on the pure review and a couple of extra stars for the sci-fi potential and the coolness factor. This movie definitely deserves a sequel and it might be one of the rare instances where the sequel is better than the original, that is if the next one can have the same dialogue concepts, the same sci-fi potential, and the same cool looking costumes!Conclusion, its worth watching because it has so much potential to be an epic tale. It might seem boring because too much time was spent on empty plot details and not enough time on building out relationships between characters.</review-text>

		<review-text>The theme of the movie was deep and very relevant.
BUTTT
I do not understand why the black panther's strength - both morally and physically was not put into more focus in the movie. i really cannot.
As a warrior in the caliber of Captain America i would expect the movie to give some weight to the fight scenes, unfortunatley T'challa's fights did not have enough focus choreography or proper editing, i never got the sense that he is a good serious fighter.
This is exactley what made captain america cool in the winter soldier.
T'challa did not have character defining choices to make that would let us know that he is dealing with something. the only &quot;choice&quot; he made was wether to stay with his ancestors or go back and fight, a choice with no weight on it.
lesset action , movies have made amazing fight scenes.
Logan for example used the action to charge the movie with tension and anticipation. This movie glossed through the fights as though it was a 60's bond movie.
I cannot understand how they blew such a critical part of this movie.

		<review-text>I rate Black Panther a solid 9. This is by far the most beautiful movie in Marvel, and the most original. This movie gives you a taste of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;Avatar&quot;, and some black nationalism. When one hears these three combined, you think &quot;wow!&quot; or &quot;how?&quot;. You can tell the planned idea was genius, but the execution could have gone much better. Now I know you've read many reviews about how good this movie is; so my focus on this review is on how this movie had a larger potential, perhaps to be the best movie of the year.
If I was the director and saw the finished product, the evaluation phase, I would immediately contact a film scorer (someone like Han Zimmer), and ask him for some intense music. The Black Panther/King of Wakanda theme was good, the feel for Wakanda's new world was pleasant; however, the most essential, emotional moments were wasted without a doubt. A scene with a script and CGI is a nice square, but a film score brings volume; it creates a cube. If you remember the final Battle in &quot;Avatar&quot;, you remember the intense music during the final battle. I need that for the final battle between Wakanda &amp; Wakanda. Or if that sets the bar too high, at least add some of the trippy music from the trailer. Or &quot;La Tentation De Simba&quot; vibes from &quot;The Lion King&quot;. I need some suspenseful music, I need a feeling of the end of relationships and the end of Wakanda. This battle was great, but a great background tone would have made it phenomenal. And not just the final battle, some &quot;Dark Knight&quot; notes for the interrogation scene perhaps. A huge improvement would've been a father-son relationship theme. Something like Mufasa's theme from &quot;The Lion King&quot;. The one-on-one challenge fight between the Killmonger and Black Panther should have had a fast-paced score. How about when Black Panther was thrown off the river? Or when he came back to life? Now that is a lot of music for one movie; however, I did say this review is solely to explain Black Panther's potential. A script is the base of the tower, acting and CGI are the construction, music piles up height. Most, not all, scenes in this film should've had something playing externally, because music can fill in emotions actors simply can't.. Those are some ideas to what could've been Black Panther's film score.
Now a problem, believe it or not, that I found was Chadwick Boseman. The star of the show had some questionable acting scenes. My first issue is his acting performance as the son of the King, he really didn't express himself well. Me being a son of a father, realize that father-son relationships affect someone. And he really didn't express emotion towards it. There were many scenes with emotion: hype and action, death, betrayal, anxiety, stress, intellectual, etc. Chadwick Boseman almost felt like he either laughed with his sister, or he had a straight-serious face; in other words, he didn't express much emotion. Now I will give him credit for acting well on the scene where he found out his dad killed his uncle, and when Forrest Whitaker (I couldn't find his character's name) died. But for the rest of the movie I was just finding myself not caring for Black Panther's character, I didn't care for the main hero, the protagonist of the movie. I also have one more comment for Chadwick Boseman, he should've gotten ripped. I need him to look like Captain America in the movie. In his initiation as a king, I was pretty surprised the Black Panther had no calves, he seemed wimpy for a superhero. So if you ask me how this movie could have gone better, I feel Chadwick's performance was a big let-down for the sentiment of the story.
The last thing, literally, to be covered is the final battle. I mentioned the film score that should've been added to the last battle, not the script nor the action. To me the last moments in Wakanda should've gone like how Avatar played on: rise in hype, loss of hope, final 1v1. And in a way the movie played this way, but Avatar's exciting battle also had beautiful creatures and wonderful visual effects. This was a chance to shoot for the stars, and Ryan Coogler missed it. He brought rhinos, but this is Wakanda, I need elephants, lions, panthers (like honestly am I the only one that thought of this), eagles, etc. Bring Africa to life in the last 20 minutes. I assure that would have gone in the books, as the most epic, final showdown. I feel the sky battle between pilots felt like a waste since it wasn't the most amazing thing, it had a cool ending, but it doesn't feel as great if the rest wasn't epic. Like I said before, add some sick music, and show the best of Wakanda that is shown in the comics. And for crying out loud, shoot a scene with Black Panther on top of the rock like in &quot;The Lion King&quot; once he wins the battle, with the people of Wakanda praising him. Do it for the fans. I liked the 1v1 at the end, and the falling scene. I enjoyed watching Killmonger against 5 different skilled women. I loved when Black Panther DESTROYED a spaceship with a vibranium spear. I just felt there was space for improvement, to make something competitive to Avatar's final battle. I'm only here to comment on it's potential.
Anyways those are some thoughts on how the movie could have improved. The movie is great as it is, but it almost feels like marvel didn't want it to be the greatest Marvel film. If these 3 elements had been added, no doubt in my mind this movie would have been the best in Marvel, perhaps the best of the year. And simply a revolutionary, example to be, superhero film.</review-text>

		<review-text>The latest film in the Marvel Universe has arrived with &quot;Black Panther&quot; and it continues the tradition of big budgeted event films from Marvel. The film follows T'Challa (Chadwick Bodeman), as he prepares to assume the throne of the country of Wakanda after the death of his father. He is destined to lead over a nation that to the outside world seems impoverished and rural, but is secretly a very technologically advanced society thanks to their Vibranium resources. The resources allow them to keep their capitol city hidden from the world.
As T'Challa attempts to assume the throne and rule over the various tribes of his country; a threat from his past both known and unknown arises. Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) surfaces, T'Challa mounts and effort to bring him to justice which in turn sets a chain of events into motion. A mysterious and deadly figure known as Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), plans to obtain the Vibranium to exact a plan of revenge so severe it will lead to the nations of the world being subjugated and will divide even the most loyal citizens of Wakanda.
T'Challa must use his powers as The Black Panther and guardian of Wakanda to save his people and the very world from a threat that holds the fate of the world in the balance.The film takes a while to get going as Director/Co-Writer Ryan Coogler takes his time introducing audiences to the world of Black Panther and especially the various characters. The strong supporting cast features Lupita Nyong'o, Angela Bassett, Danai Gurira, Forest Whitaker, Martin Freeman, and so many others that it is great to see such well-rounded characters.The film does take a while to get up to the action but when it arrives; it delivers making the wait worth it. What I really liked was that the characters were well-defined as were their motivations. You did not have some cartoon mega-villain with some insane scheme, but rather a realistic and believable threat whose motivations were understandable though misguided.
Marvel has again delivered a very thrilling story that fits well into their extended universe and you will want to make sure to stay through all the credits for the two additional scenes which sets up future events for the Marvel Universe. &quot;Black Panther&quot; is a rousing success all around continues Marvel's Cinematic Universe in grand style.4.5 stars out of 5</review-text>

		<review-text>After watching Guardians 3, I told myself that Black Panther would be the last MCU film I'd watch. For one, I had become a DC fanboy, and two, the MCU formula had gotten pretty stale and repetitive. But, after seeing Civil War, I kept remembering Black Panther, and the fact that his father had been killed, leaving him as the new ruler of the mysterious Wakanda. That could set up something great for a Black Panther movie. If the teaser was at least half good, I'd see it. Not only was the teaser and the second trailer great, but the actors chosen blew my mind. Forest Whitaker, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Michael B. Jordan, all great choices.The story: Following the assassination of king T'Chaka in Civil War, T'Challa is the new king of Wakanda, the mysterious nation that's hiding untold treasures and technological Marvels. The story follows T'Challa rise to become worthy as king, all the while having to face off against a new enemy, Eric Killmonger, who plans to take the throne, his power and his secrets,I love the look of Wakanda; the culture shows that while Wakandan's are technologically advanced, they also integrate that into their culture and clothing. I think Ryan Coogler did a great job with the look and feel of Wakandan culture. Some of the new characters are great editions. T'Challa's mother Ramonda, his sister Shuri, his best friend W'Kabi. I even enjoyed Nakia, Nyong'o's character. Shuri had to be my favourite, and I really liked all the tech she created; that projection/hologram suit she made was amazing. I also enjoyed the Dora Milaje, the all women guard T'Challa had; you really feel their devotion and loyalty to Wakanda.But yes, there are things I was disappointed with in this film, one way or the other. One thing I was disappointed about was how little we got to see of T'Challa's kingship. All the advertisement is telling you &quot;his time is now&quot;, &quot;get ready for a new king&quot;. I was watching this film waiting for T'Challa to &quot;take charge&quot; and show us why he's worthy, but the only real thing that makes him worthy I guess is that he's royalty. I wanted something like Thor where he's stripped, and proves himself worthy but sacrificing his life. I guess we have that by the end, but I wanted that to be his whole character arc. Overall, he's crowned king after beating this Ape tribe leader in a duel, goes to capture Klawe at a casino, and immediately faces Killmonger, loses, is revived, and goes back to defeat him. That's all well and good, but I needed something more than that to scream &quot;he's the true, inspiring king we need&quot;. If the last 20 minutes are defining that, then some, naming I, was a little disappointed.Overall, an entertaining movie, and interesting edition to the MCU. I love Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa. I love the look of Wakanda, Vibranium, and all the technology Wakanda is hiding. T'Challa could have been developed a bit more, but at least I care about his character now. Even though this film didn't win me back to the MCU, I'm glad I watched it. Wouldn't really watch it again though.I'm giving this a 7 out of 10</review-text>

		<review-text>I got to see this film a few a days back and It was....mind numbingly mediocre just like most other MCU films. Maybe I had too high expectations for it due to the hype but a lot of elements felt way worse than other marvel flicks.The action(both fight scenes and action set pieces) ranged from semi-decent to God awful. The final fight in particular had terrible CGI and wonky physics. The normal fight scenes weren't that good either. They were both shot(sometimes it feels like the cameraman is having a seizure while the combatants are having a slap fight, sample of what you're going to get I guess) and choreographed terribly. It's like they watched the fight style of the Raid films but forgot hire good stuntmen and choreographers.The MCU can do really intense fight scenes like the elevator fight in TWS but nothing in this movie comes even close to that. So anyone expecting badass fights based on BPs scenes in civil war, you're going to be massively disappointed.Edit: sample of the final fight I am talking about as wellThis isn't a work print. This is what you will get in the cinema. I got called a troll for saying it. So you can look at it yourselves.If anybody thought the CGI in wonder woman climax was a turn off , then you're certainly not going to like this and unlike WW the CGI is like this in most CGI heavy scenes in the film.(particularly the car chase yikes).The world building is good if you think Bright and the Star wars prequels had great world building. It just felt artificial for the most part(again partly because of the mediocre CGI), you're not going to get a memorable location like the cantina bar or the Troll market from Hellboy 2 which feels like real places with it's own unique personalities. Wakanda for the most part like Asgard has a few cool establishing shots where we see some interesting designs but they're are not really fleshed out much and again the uneven CGI isn't exactly helping.The villain is above 99% of other marvel villains for he mere fact he has a lasting impact on he hero and for being somewhat sympathetic, though I felt the characterization itself was a bit disjointed. However his dialogue is often absolute cringe, he seems to awkwardly switch on and off his AAVE which just seems forced. I thought his final piece dialogue for example was absolutely forced and cringeworthy. The actor, I think did his best with what he got and he felt more interesting than the rest of the characters in the movie.The music was decent in this movie(though I didn't care for the rap which was mostly centered around Eric but then again I am not huge rap fan, so don't out too much weight on my opinion on this one). Most of it's themes are pretty obvious and blatant as well.This movie definitely isn't going to win any awards for subtlety.Overall, the movie just felt generic.I know movies are subjective but anyone who says this is a masterpiece or groundbreaking in anyway whether it be effects, acting,action or even the plot(I don't think this movie does anything new or anything that's even new for CBMs except for the nearly all black cast I guess) is quite frankly a fanboy or someone who hasn't watched much films.That's all I have to say about this movie. It's solid 5/10 for me but I am guessing if you liked the previous MCU films you'll probably enjoy this as well but for others go in with tempered expectations.</review-text>

		<review-text>Ryan Coogler, relative new comer, and director of 2015's Creed, does an incredible job of realising this complex character first introduced in the third Captain America movie, Civil War, Black Panther was an integral part of the storyline and captured audience's attention with a flair for spectacular action stunts. Black panther stands triumphantly as it's own story, understood to be taking place in the grander scheme, but telling a story firmly rooted in it's own world, and not leaning too hard into being an infinity War lead-up. Compared to plethora of MCU films, and even to the current deluge of films in the super-hero genre, with releases this year from Fox, Sony, and others, Black Panther is a fun solid start to 2018's year of the superhero.The film has spectacular action sequences, a beautifully moving and creative score, design work evoking African culture while melding with fictional advanced technology. However, the film is not without its faults. The plot is predictable when it's not all over the place. The script fails to endear us to characters in the way the score is begging us to feel. Many characters' motivations are constantly undefined. And the 3D conversion is nauseating (and that's coming from someone who ALWAYS chooses the watch a movie in 3D if available).There is a moment in the Avengers where Thor says of Thanos' intentions that his interest in Earth stems from the fact that Earth has demonstrated they are ready for a higher form of war, and Black Panther asks the audience to accept a higher form of superhero film, and while I applauded it for its attempt, and for the moments where it succeeds, that just makes the moments where it falters all the more disappointing and unforgivable.You can't ask an audience to come along on a more intellectual movie and then hand them a B grade superhero flick. I don't fault critics for being so overwhelmingly positive about this movie, it's a good movie with a positive message, and I'm rating it positively too, it's just not the movie we needed, it's not the Messiah that it's being hailed as.Wonder woman needed to be good so that we can get other female led superhero films. Black panther needed to be good because we need better minority representation in films, in genre films specifically. Not just in characters, but in story. And in that regard, it will undoubtedly succeed in making sure studio executives believe investing in movies like Black Panther is a good idea and will bring audiences to the theatres in droves. In that way the movie has most definitely succeed.</review-text>

		<review-text>&quot;Black Panther Down&quot; is the movie directed by Ridley Scott and starring Orlando Bloom for 2 seconds. Alright, I'm just joking. It's been a long day, but I got the chance to check out the new Marvel movie, which I had no real expectations for. The marketing didn't get me hooked and it all sort of felt underwhelming to me. But I wanted to see it since I liked the Black Panther a lot in ''Civil War'' with his &quot;I don't care&quot; attitude. The character did grow with his own little story arc, so when you see him now, he's become a more responsable man. The movie was fine in my eyes. It's your usual Marvel picture when it comes to story and visuals, but at least it's an entertaining flick with enough craziness to keep you locked in for two hours. That's something I feel that the guys at Marvel aren't afraid of anymore; to go all out with the comic book weirdness and sometimes campyness. Now they wanna embrace it. Which has been strongly evident in the last &quot;Thor&quot; movie. That's not to say that there isn't any grittiness, because there is. It's all combined into one here. I'll applaud them for going to new places. But the end result didn't stick out to be more than mainly a fun time with popcorn at the movies.I would have probably changed the visual style more if I was the one making it. Can they use less green-screen next time, please? It's Africa! I wanna see the savannas and the fantastic nature sights. There's an over-reliance of just resorting to fake digital backgrounds rather than using real locations. The digital gloom over everything lessened the visual appeal for me. But, hey! That's just the look. How's the story? Yeah, it's decent. I liked the grounded stuff mixed with African culture and/or mythology. The Wakandan technology and civilization was jarring to me at first sight. Not even Tony Stark has that level of tech. It was too much of a future city for my taste. Although the question of why the Wakandan tech never has been heard before is brought in the movie as a major plot point. So I thought it was nice that it was addressed. The characters are fun and everyone brings a nice charisma to the screen. Chadwick Boseman, Lupita NYong'o and Forest Whittaker give their absolute care to the movie. It's no paycheck day for sure. It feels like Martin Freeman basically just hanged around on set. I was happy to see him there though. Because he would see and react to Wakandan culture like we, the audience would. The villains are good, but like in most previous Marvel films; they get sidelined again. Andy Serkis brought a fantastic personality to his mischievous guy, but his screen-time is limited. That was an unwise choice. Michael B. Jordan (AKA Creed) is also very interesting and unique. Not very often these days when you can understand the villain's motive so well. The main group are, like I mentioned, good and all.. But, the biggest problem I have is that the story line goes to all the expected places. It's pretty much like &quot;we've done all of this stuff before&quot;. I wasn't surprised by where the plot ended up going because it's usual business and all so going through the familiar beats. It would have been more fun with some different twists. The action is entertaining. You even get a ''Skyfall''-like casino scene, but with some additional slow-mo fighting, of course.Did I care for the story? Sure. There are neat moments and a fun adventure with good heroes to root for. None of it was captivating enough to raise my enjoyment unfortunately. I could see the emotional things and what they were trying to do. But, I didn't feel it. Black Panther is a superhero I've know almost nothing about. That's the reason I decided to go in as blank as I could. I would have loved to have been surprised, but I got a fun action movie with like-able heroes instead. Ultimately the character is sort of a mix of &quot;The Phantom&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot;. I'm a fan of both those two and if you haven't read the Phantom comics, then I would highly recommend them. I wanted to see more of the tone you'd read there. It's grounded, but it feels a little fantastical too. The jungle is dark and mysterious. Filled with many legends and roads to unknown adventures. Well, I think my review has ended up too long, so I'll wrap it up. I'm sure Black Panther can become even better down the line, if there's more focus on delivering something less predictable and maybe more personal. Oh, and delve into the mythology and the mysticism more next time. It did what it had to do; to entertain and make audiences feel familiar with Wakanda. Now my though is that &quot;Infinity War&quot; better deliver. Show me what 10 years of this Cinematic Universe has been leading up to. Do not play it safe, please. Any way, &quot;Black Panther&quot; was fine. It's a good time, but it should have had more weight.</review-text>

		<review-text>We toddled off to see BLACK PANTHER and I renewed my Hoyts Seniors card and got in for nothing! Yay me! 
And it was worth every cent too.The Black Panther is the newly minted king of Wakanda, a super-dooper advanced country hidden in Africa like skull Island is hidden in the Pacific but there's no giant ape although there are fucking ginormous CGI armoured rhinoceroses but more on them later.A black panther is the melanistic color variant of any big cat species but in this case, it being Africa, izza Leopard! So to remove any reference to colour (although the educated will know that black isn't actually a colour) King T'Challa could have been non-judgementally called 'Melanistic Leopard' but that doesn't, I suppose, have the same ring to it. Wakanda has heaps and heaps of a metal that I can't remember the name of but it's terribly, terribly useful and rare and it is the reason that they are so advanced. Aliens might've given it to them. Dunno. Can't remember that either. They also have some purple plants that give the king his Melanistic Leopard powers and this is just what the Dockers need. Except Nat Fyfe. He doesn't need it.There are also some fierce warrior chicks who are like Amazons but aren't from an island. They scowl (a lot!) and are the King's special bodyguards. But not like Colonel Gaddafi's bodyguards, at least I don't think so. There is a lovable sidekick who is a CIA operative and a nasty villain who is a Yarpie (obviously!)King T'Challa's father has just died and this sets the scene for the sort of conflict that is central to any Marvel movie. Yes, there is another claimant to the throne who appears and he has hundreds and hundreds of what appear to be little boils, each of which represent someone he killed. I think. Who they were or why they were killed I cannot recall, but he's from America, so anyone really.His father was killed by T'Challa's father so there's bad blood aplenty. T'Challa has a sister who is terribly good at inventing things like new Black Panther suits sort of like Tony Stark except she doesn't get to wear 'em and she's a chick..The new claimant wants to take over the world and right centuries of wrongs done to Africans and their descendants worldwide and violence is his weapon combined with other weapons made out of terribly, terribly useful and rare metal. And he wants to do it NOW! King T'Challa favours a more measured approach to world domination using a creeping goodness and mercy and understanding strategy. No-one is stepping up to redress the wrongs done to Australian Aboriginals, or first nations folk from other, more heavily armed, countries.In the finest tradition of Marvel there is a really big battle between the two forces, and the usurper has the CG ginormous rhinoceroses who cut a swathe though King T'Challa's forces but are tamed by someone that they used to know and she gets her face licked. They, the CG armour clad rhinos, don't look very real. Although I've never seen a real ginormous armoured rhinoceros so I might be judging them unfairly. In my view, the battle scene would've been heaps better if there had been a contingent of Welsh infantry singing 'Men of Harlech'. I suppose some will ponder upon who was good, and who was evil, or were either of them good or evil or on infinite variations of the two. But I didn't.Is it a parable? Does King T'Challa represent Martin Luther King? Does usurper-guy represent Malcolm X? Or the prophet Mohammed? Dunno. Is it any good?
Look. I may not have been part of the target demographic. Lots of clever and self important reviewers have compared it, favourably, to bees-knees. Me? Not so much. It's better'n Interstellar, but so is having an eyeball removed with a spoon that has just been licked by, say, Jabba the Hutt.A bit dull.</review-text>

		<review-text>I am a big comic fan. Both in the literal sense of my stature and weight, and in the extent in which I enjoy the medium. I rarely actually find time to read comics, despite having no real job or any other vacuum of time. Still, I can remember when I was younger and my attention span hadn't been eroded into nothingness. Back then, I had many favourite characters. There was the classics like Spider-Man, and the more niche choices such as Moon Knight. Somewhere in the middle was King T'Challa, or the Black Panther if you would prefer. I won't go the full route of claiming that, since I am of mixed race, a character of a racial minority helped guide me and give me confidence, acting as my sole role-model. Still, though, it was quite interesting as a child seeing the other half of what I came from. Granted, my great-grandfather was Jamaican, but the concept remains the same. I don't believe there is a mixed race superhero (though do please correct me if I'm wrong) but I also don't really need one. When I heard that Black Panther movie was announced, I quickly became nervous. Obviously, I was elated that one of my childhood favourites would finally be getting a big-screen adaptation. Still, I was worried that the film would push politics into my semi-developed brain. Recently, there's been quite the surge of people demanding representation. Obviously, this should happen. Black people exist, and they should be shown in film. The same goes for everyone else, regardless of race, gender etc. Personally, however, I feel this has come at the expense of quality. Finn, the first main black character in Star Wars, is an embarrassment in my mind. While many applauded Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, I feel both her acting, and the film as a whole, were lacking. She simply fits the character well, allowing her to pass semi-believably. I was horribly nervous that Black Panther would be yet another casualty to this. I thought he might abide by all black stereotypes by being loud, emotional and overly aggressive. Much to my relief, this film seemed to understand this, and avoid it.In the comics. T'Challa is a wise and level-headed king. Obviously, in the films, he is currently younger than he is often shown on the page, but these traits are still present. He is dignified and a strong leader, but isn't above enjoying himself every now and then. Unlike many other Marvel protagonists, T'Challa isn't cracking jokes mid-fight. He remains serious, grounded in the severity of the situations he finds himself in. He doesn't seem to find much pleasure in combat, he simply does it because, ultimately, it is often the right thing to do. The villain, on the other hand, is almost the polar opposite. In another film, Killmonger may well end up as the misunderstood Anti-hero protagonist. Here, however, he is treated as well intentioned but ultimately misguided. This is something I can respect. I was truly surprised by this film; I expected the protagonist and antagonist's personalities to be reversed, but I ended up with the film I didn't know I wanted.The characters are quite wonderful. Both T'Challa and his younger sister Shuri are handled wonderfully, and I could actually believe their sibling bond. In fact, Shuri (despite one horribly misplaced attempt at reviving a meme) ended up being one of my favourite characters in the film. She wasn't a stereotypical 'strong and independant woman' character. She was both of those things, but she also had her own flaws and imperfections, separating her from the ranks of Rey and Diana Prince. The writing in addition to Letitia Wright's wonderful performance made for a great character I'd love to see more from. Michael B. Jordan has an odd place in my superhero-oriented mind. I doubt I can forgive him for 'Fant4stic' but his performance in this film almost changed my mind. His character as shown in the trailers looked incredibly forgettable and one-note, but in the film, it's a very different story. I shan't give any spoilers for those who are yet to see it, but I doubt anybody will be left disappointed. It was definitely a direction I hadn't expected both Marvel and Disney to go in, and I'm incredibly pleased by the mature and politically neutral choices.I wasn't really a fan of Martin Freeman's character in Civil War (he was only really there to be in this, despite what his character's name may suggest) and he's perfectly serviceable in this. Honestly, rather ironically, he just seems to be here for diversity, in an attempt to show that not all white people are evil. Himself and Andy Serkis even took to calling themselves the marvellously titled 'Tolkien white boys'. Speaking of Mister Serkis, he seemed to be having an absolute blast. Each scene he was in was packed with energy. Unfortunately, he was horribly underused. I'd love to see him in some future films, as unlikely as it would seem.Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa, as I mentioned previously, was wonderful. I'm now nervous for Infinity War; I fear they may do the character an injustice by showing him too little, or writing him poorly. I do feel I can safely rule out the actor as a problem if anything goes wrong; this performance shows he can carry a film.It's rare that I'd give a whole section of a review to this, but the action was brilliant. The climax of the film was overly busy for my tastes (there was basically three fights going on at once) but each aspect was given a great deal of detail. While I am a novice in the subject, I believe I saw various different forms of martial arts at play during various duels etc. It was pleasant seeing real technique used rather than the classic Marvel method of 'hit him really hard' or 'shoot a laser'. It was also incredibly brutal; there was blood used frequently, and each punch actually looked like it hurt. Towards the end, there was a moment where there really should have been blood, but I feel censorship may have intervened; they probably want as many people to see this film as possible, children included. Personally, I would have rather seen the climax come down to a simple duel to really show off the choreography and talent at play. Nevertheless, the film was thoroughly enjoyable.The music was used incredibly intelligently. From the trailer, I feared it would all simply be rap music. I've nothing against the genre, but it wouldn't fit the comicbook character. To my relief, however, music was used incredibly intelligently. If you know of the musical 'Hamilton' you may understand. Within it, rap mostly follows the titular character, while the character of Aaron Burr is closer to RnB, featuring more vocal talent and soul rather than blisteringly quick verses. A similar technique is used here. T'Challa is accompanied by what I assume is classic African music, while Killmonger is followed by hiphop, fitting their characters brilliantly. Rather ironically, when the more traditional superhero music reared it's head, it was a disappointment. This film probably has the best music of any Marvel film. I'm actually considering buying the album by Kendrick Lamar in order to support the film further.Even from a regular film perspective, I think this film succeeded. The cinematography was gorgeous at times. It occasionally fell into the more standard, dull, static shots, but for the most part, it was great. The visual effects were also, as to be expected, impressive. Much like Iron Man, I found myself longing for a suit of my own. (Any scientists reading, add this to the list. Along with real Pokemon and so on.)There was a few minor inaccuracies and inconsistencies, but compared to how I feel about many Disney films nowadays, I feel this film was, to put it simply, a marvel. It might simply be because I am writing this right after seeing it, but this is probably one of my favourite Marvel films period. I daren't give a 10, lest I regret it later, so instead I'll give it a 9.5/10. It was the most fun I've had in a cinema watching a film like this since Logan. I wish to thank Ryan Coogler, the cast and crew for smashing my expectations and restoring some hope in the Marvel franchise. Black Panther is now in cinemas, and I implore you all to watch it. For anyone wondering, there is two end credits scenes. One in the middle, and one at the end.(Completely unrelated, please be quite during a film viewing in the cinema? I appreciate this doesn't apply to 99.99% of you, so thanks, but while I watched this, there was a group of teenage girls behind me. They spoke through the entire film, so I now know which of the cast they'd most like to have sex with. Congratulations, I suppose, Mr. Jordan.)</review-text>

		<review-text>The hero of the tale is, of course, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the king of Wakanda and, as the Black Panther, protector of his people. Having drunk the nectar of a mystical flower, he has the strength of many men; in a suit woven of bullet-proof vibranium, he is virtually indestructible. (That's the Marvel part.) Indeed, Wakanda itself is built on the bounty of a meteorite bearing vibranium-the strongest metal on Earth-that struck Africa millennia ago. Technologically advanced beyond the dreams of any other nation, Wakanda cloaks itself from the world behind an illusory rainforest. As far as the rest of the world knows, it is a &quot;third-world country-textiles, shepherds, cool outfits.&quot;As the new king-his father having been killed in Captain America: Civil War, the movie that first introduced Black Panther-T'Challa is supported, and occasionally hindered, by an assortment of family, colleagues, and rivals: his younger sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright), a precocious tech genius who outshines even Tony Stark; his regal mother, Ramonda (Angela Bassett); the kingdom's high priest, Zuri (Forest Whitaker); T'Challa's best friend and chief of the border guard, W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya); the surly chief of a rebellious clan, M'Baku (Winston Duke); his chief general and head of the Dora Milaje, an all-female royal honor guard, Okoye (Danai Gurira); and T'Challa's former flame, Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), who is also a covert agent for the Dora Milaje.As with any superhero movie, there are a handful of smaller-scale fights leading to one large-scale melee that is completely bonkers (complete with armored, rambunctious African wildlife), but the best parts of the movie fall in the spaces between those fights. T'Challa's royal blood makes him the rightful heir to the throne, and with that great power comes a set of great challenges - or rather, one great challenge that dictates every other challenge he's about to face.But Black Panther isn't just T'Challa's story. It's also Killmonger's, He's a lost son whose father was killed by the king, and that king prevented him from achieving his birthright and destiny.
The plot and the story connects well. 
Kendrick Lamar's score is amazing. Andy Serkis is the show stealer. M'Baku is hilarious.
The humor is well fitted in the story which actually suits the process. No useless humor. Action sequences are kickass. 
Coming to the cons this movie it's that the climax plot was a bit predictable. But the pros do cover up this small con.
So For a superhero origin movie it's a good start.
A must watch. WAKANDA FOREVER.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther continues with the story of T'Challa/Black Panther(Chadwick Boseman), after the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016). After a family tragedy, T'Challa ascends to the throne &amp; becomes king of Wakanda. Black Panther is a mind-blowing film. The Marvel Cinematic Universe delivers another flawless masterpiece. Director Ryan Coogler, brings his own unique directing style to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That makes this movie more unique, than the previous films set in this universe. The visual effects are fantastic. The 3D is eye-popping. The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. Kudos to production designer Hannah Beachler, for making Wakanda look absolutely gorgeous &amp; otherworldly. Chadwick Boseman is brilliant as T'Challa/Black Panther. Boseman effectively portrays T'Challa's various emotions &amp; inner conflicts. Michael B. Jordan is spectacular as Erik Killmonger. Lupita Nyong'o is outstanding as Nakia. Danai Gurira is excellent as Okoye. Martin Freeman is awesome as Everett K. Ross. Daniel Kaluuya is excellent as W'Kabi. Letitia Wright is amazing as Shuri. Winston Duke is great as M'Baku. Sterling K. Brown is unforgettable as N'Jobu. Angela Bassett is impressive as Ramonda. Forest Whitaker is good as Zuri. Andy Serkis gives the performance of a lifetime, as Ulysses Klaue.

		<review-text>I have been a comic book fan for years and when it comes to comic books being adapted to movies, I know that the Marvel Cinematic Universe never disappoints. Various talented directors and writers have created some widely entertaining movies in this franchise, some of them that actually have emotional depth that makes them remarkable and able to stand out from the rest of this popular genre. But what Ryan Coogler has accomplished with this movie comes closer to the work of Christopher Nolan and James Mangold, when they worked on &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; and &quot;Logan&quot;, respectively.The movie's connection to the shared universe is well established from the very beginning, but I just admired how it's very much of its own thing. The world-building is done so well that it literally makes you not only want to visit Wakanda, but live in there. That's due to the film's powerfully-written screenplay (by Coogler and Joe Robert Cole), which is also responsible for this film having some of the most fully realised and humane characters in cbm history, flawlessly brought to life by the film's charismatic and professional cast - a cast where everyone gets their moment to shine. My favorites were Chadwick Boseman as the inspiring Wakandian king T'Challa (a.k.a. Black Panther), Michael B. Jordan as the menacing Erik Killmonger (one of the most satisfying villains in movie history), Letitia Wright as T'Challa's young, genius and hilarious sister Shuri and the entire Dora Milaje crew (particularly Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira).Apart from the film's ability to have such a rich cast, its main story is an emotional rollercoaster filled with important social commentary that doesn't downgrade the movie or make it &quot;annoyingly/forced politically correct&quot;. The choreography and cinematography of the action sequences is sensational and unique (Rachel Morrison better get an Oscar), as is the brilliant score and soundtrack (thank you Kendrick Lamar). All in all, Marvel Studios' &quot;Black Panther&quot; is an excellent and impeccable production that should be celebrated, not just for being a big budget tentpole film with a largely black cast and crew, but for its quality, which is the result of some talented and hard working people, no matter what their race or skin colour or gender is. Coogler and Feige have delivered a masterpiece that manages to stand above the rest of the MCU and the majority of comic book movies and blockbusters in general. My anticipation for the sequels of this movie has officially reached &quot;Infinity War&quot; level. Bring it on, Marvel!</review-text>

		<review-text>I kept wondering how the story about wakanda's super secret city &amp; strength be revealed to the audience. And I couldn't have expected any better, simpler, crispier father-son narrative on why wakanda is the way it is!
Black Panther covers most of Marvel's ingredients, but it feels to have gravely lacked in finding the proportions. There were hardly a couple of scenes that was really funny. Neither the story nor the plot felt fulfilling. Story was weak, didn't cover much but just revolved around the technical advances of Wakanda's super secret city and its rituals. Plot could have been better, didn't have much coverage either. VFX was really good, and that was it.
Killmonger was shown the main villain, but for some reason Klaw seemed a better and audience loving villain who got killed in a jiffy. Killmonger needed a stronger background and story showing him more competitive to the black panther, but it was just his muscles, attitude and an american accent that took more coverage (oh i missed &quot;Nay&quot;. You'll know what i mean).
 Black Panther is not as much a negative movie as i might have made it sound, but the expectations for various reason were so high, that the movie just failed to meet it. Although it is a definite 1 time watcher, but one lacks the content of having watched a full-package Marvel movie simply because there just wasn't enough of everything.Black Panther a one time watcher if you are a Marvel's fan. Else the film will interest you only in parts.
IMBD's 7.6 as on date is almost justified, although i would give it a 7.1/10 in the long term.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is the eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is directed by Ryan Coogler. The film follows T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), shortly after the events of Civil War. He takes his rightful place as king of Wakanda, a technologically advanced city that is hidden in Africa. He quickly faces challenges though, as Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), comes for the throne.The best aspect of the film is Wakanda. Director Ryan Coogler creates an authentic setting that is full of vibrant colors, beautiful scenery, fascinating culture, and advancements in technology. There are some beautiful shots in the film that are complimented by the excellent color choice. The culture is truly fascinating from its great costumes to its interesting traditions. There is also a nice contrast within the culture, of old and new. While Wakanda is constantly innovating, it stays grounded in it's old and unique traditions. Wakanda's advancements in technology are fun to watch, whether it's in action sequences or the daily lifestyles of a Wakandan. This is world-building at its finest. Coogler gives us an authentic world that feels lived in, compared to other settings in the MCU like Asgard from the Thor franchise.The action sequences can be best described as fluent. These sequences are fast-paced and well choreographed. The Wakandan technology makes these sequences exciting. These are simply some of the most entertaining sequences ever seen in the MCU.Chadwick Boseman gives you that slick and intelligent character that is expanded upon in the film.The chemistry is great, especially in the four main protagonists. T'Challa and each member of his crew have believable relationships and each character serve their own purpose within his crew. Letitia Wright's Shuri and T'Challa have a dynamic relationship, where they actually feel like siblings. She also accounts for most of the comic relief in the film. Danai Gurira's Okoye is an all business character that is loyal to her king. Lupita Nyong'o plays Nakia. While she is mostly there as T'Challa's love interest, she has her own set of goals that adds another layer to her character, as well as T'Challas.The character that really steals the show is Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger. His character has powerful and clear motivations, that some might even find relatable. This makes his character conflicting for the viewer as they choose between him and T'Challa. While most villains in the MCU suffer from being poorly written, Killmonger has some great scenes that build up his character and give his character a legitimate purpose that most MCU villains lack. Killmonger even causes T'Challa to question himself, which is the mark of a great villain. Yet he still felt like he didn't get enough screen time and some of the scenes in this film could have easily been replaced with scenes that give more insight into his character.The film had few negatives, but they're worth talking about. This film lacks emotional moments. Without the emotional moments, this film lends itself as a very predictable one. The film does have social commentary and some political agendas. The political agendas take the form of two lines though. The lines still feel like they were throw in there and just felt unnecessary in a Marvel film.Overall, Black Panther is unlike any Marvel experience I have ever had. This film definitely feels like a Marvel film, but it separates itself from its predecessors. Coogler creates an authentic setting that has a lot going for it. The film boasts great effects, action sequences, and cinematography. The film has excellent main and supporting characters. Killmonger is one of the best Marvel villains to date but still didn't get enough screen time. The film is predictable and has some unnecessary political agendas. Like I said, Black Panther is a unique experience. One that certainly should be experienced in the theaters. My score: 8.0/10</review-text>

		<review-text>This movie has been overhyped and arguably overrated no doubt but it does indeed deliver on what it promised, to add no film is above criticism. You really delve into the world of Wakanda a technological and cultural phenomenon. It is very well realised, the colour palette is great and there are some really nice shots.Every single character is interesting and fun, although a few were one dimensional the actors somehow make up for it. Standouts were Chadwick Boseman, Andy Serkis and Winston Duke. When the tribal fights occur it just heightens the drama and I loved that. The Dora milage are also great too(okoye is a badass).Not to mention this film had a spectacular soundtrack by Ludwig Goransson that stays true to African music while still having a twinge of hip hop beats. Best soundtrack since the winter soldier, had to stop my self dancing in my seat.The 'villain' is compelling and presents an interesting discussion to be had in relation to Wakanda and sharing their wealth with others who need it. However, I did find the character of Killmonger tiring at times, he is a hot headed fool but eh.My major gripes were really the CGI fight scenes and the first 20 minutes were almost awful, but when this film picks up boi does it pick up. The humour is also hilarious most of the time but a few jokes made me die inside *what ArE THooOse*I genuinely don't understand how anyone can give this film 1s and 4s and in the same breath give other mcu films good scores and I love the MCU. I also can't help but notice a trend in the type of people who give it such scores, it's either that they are dc fanboys or right wing snowflakes just as there are left wing snowflakes. I hate to get into politics but it is a sad reality surrounding this film. Perhaps film is truly subjective?</review-text>

		<review-text>Had its moments, and was enjoyable, but they hype train derails pretty quick.
I did like how the story was about Black Panther, and his origin as king, not really about him becoming BP (he was already that in Civil War). There were lots of people saying things like &quot;breaks the Marvel mold&quot; This is a brave new direction for superhero films&quot;.
It doesn't and its not. The only one that has changed the mold was Winter Soldier, a movie that was a spy thriller first and a super hero movie second, but we are not talking about that movie here.
The acting in the movie, for the most part, is fine. Some actors really did need to step up their game, but they didn't get too much time wasted on them.The villain, though better with his motives, was just as forgettable as the rest of the villains in this franchise.If you are a marvel fan, yes you will like it, if you are a super hero fan, yes you will like it....will you need to come back and see it again...well I don't, but hey maybe they hype worked on you....</review-text>

		<review-text>Good movie with the theme of family problems with royal culture. In this film will be presented progress and tradition that complement each other. In this film we can not fully judge who is good and evil, because each character has its own goals that can be spelled 'good'.The lack of this film is the scope of the small problem that makes many characters not so developed.</review-text>

		<review-text>I can't help but think that the people who gave this movie less than 5 stars are bias and hateful. I can understand some of the criticism given. Some things are becoming a bit repetitive in the Super Hero movies but to give it a 1 star or even 2 or 3 stars is just ridiculous! Now that that is out of the way...The movie is a visual spectacle, now, I know many movies are nowadays. Besides it just looking good, it feels good. It has strong female characters like we havent seen in a while. Which is refreshing. The plot, predictable but satisfying. Acting, top notch and all in all an extremely enjoyable movie.My 10 star rating is like the 1 star ratings. Not really the rating it deserves (i would give it 8 stars) but I feel like I need to at least do something about that. I don't review very often but to see this movie getting bashed for the wrong reasons, just pissed me off a little!Sorry for the rant.Go watch it!</review-text>

		<review-text>Dont listen to the naysayers who are merely bashing this film out of hate for the hype about the mostly black cast. From Chadwick Boseman to Lupita N'yongo , every performance was stellar. story was intriguing, I was really invested in the villains political views as well as the black panther. The story was paced just perfectly not a dull moment. Everyone did an amazing job from the director, Ryan Coogler to the producers and especially the film crew. MY GOD, the cinematography was absolutely stunning. The visuals were amazing I almost which I could live in Wakanda. All in all a great film start to finish and if you don't hate the racial makeup of the cast I promise you will love this movie 100/10.</review-text>

		<review-text>When the going gets tough, the tough gets going.Not that in the comic book film universe, the going has got tough for Marvel due to DC Comics. We all know how Justice League ended up. The going has got tough for Marvel because of Marvel itself. Civil War and Thor: Ragnarok in their own way set the new gold standards. Also, as new characters enter the MCU, the treatment needs to change too. A comic book blockbuster today needs to be more than just a comic book blockbuster- and that is what makes Black Panther great. With gracious heroes, quipping villains, rocking car chases and fantastic weapons, it is an out and out enjoyable comic book blockbuster for sure. Elements of espionage sagas with homage to 007 Bond, paired with Afro futurist themes along with some Shakespearean twists gives the movie it's own flavor. Marvel movies are increasingly getting interlinked, so for someone who has missed Civil War, there is a lot to catch up. For someone who hasn't, we jump straight into Black Panther roots and origins. &quot;Ulysses Klaue: Tell me something. What do you know about Wakanda?
Everett K. Ross: It's a Third-World country. Textiles, shepherds, cool outfits.
Ulysses Klaue: All a front. Explorers have searched for it, called it &quot;El Dorado&quot;. They looked for it in South America, but it was in Africa the whole time. I'm the only one who's seen it, and made it out alive.&quot;Welcome to Wakanda- blessed with mountains of vibranium, it is the most advanced society in the world. Fearful of the world's reaction to it's vibranium reserves, its culture and people, for centuries Wakanda has hidden it's true progress from the rest of the world. So while the motto is not &quot;America First&quot;, but it is &quot;Wakanda Forever&quot;.While T'Çhalla wants to stay the path, there are others who feel Wakanda should share it's success with the rest of Africa, who have been brutalized by invasion, exploitation and colonization. &quot;To be or not to be the savior of the oppressed world&quot; - this Shakespearean choice for the characters forms the crux of the story. The hunt for Ulysses Klaue sets in motion the plans of Erik Killmonger- an American mercenary wronged in the past by the Wakandan royal family, and scarred by his experiences in the real world. T'Challa will need to draw up on every ounce of strength, and all the friends he has to save Wakanda. Director Ryan Coogler is coming off Creed, and he delivers here too by crafting a movie that isn't about fighting gods and robots, or chasing aliens, but more about the rights to privilege. In Erik Killmonger, he has created a villain to whom at least half the audience will agree too. Wakandans have thrived while the rest of Africa has burned. Killmonger has a point. He has also assembled the finest set of black actors working today- Chadwick Boseman plays Black Panther with pathos, Lupita Nyong'o exudes radiance as Nakia, a covert agent, Michael B. Jordan plays Killmonger with feral intensity, Forest Whitaker plays Zuri, the royal shaman while Angela Bassett plays Ramona, the queen mother. The standout characters though are Shuri, played by Letitia Wright, and Okoyo, played by Danai Gurira. Said to be smarter than Tony Stark, Shuri is the Q to T'Challa's Bond, and goes about her role with vibrancy and style. Okoyo is the badass leader of T'Challa's bodyguards, stars in the action sequences and also delivers some of the funniest lines. And I especially loved Andy Serkis in front of the camera as a maniacal Klaue! Coogler has really soaked up the culture of the continent and let his imagination run wild. Wakanda is a riot of colors, steeped in spirituality and culture and because it was undisturbed by colonization - also a technological marvel. Is this what Africa could have been?Bottomline- Black Panther is not only a fun movie, it is also a very impactful movie. Marvel getting marvelous, really!

		<review-text>Having watched all the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) I have enjoyed all of them except for Iron Man 3 which is the only misstep - I will be as objective and unbiased in my review as possible.My top three rankings of the MCU movies are Winter Soldier, Iron Man and The Avengers.Where does Black Panther rank. Well it's safe to say whilst this movie isn't perfect it's easily the best MCU movie ever. Its groundbreaking and very entertaining, Coogler hit this one out of the ballpark.Characters both good and evil have depth, the story which picks up where Civil War left is both a continuation and stand alone story. New comers will feel at home. Michael B Jordan's portrayal of Killmonger has elevated MCU villains to new heights. He will have a long lasting impact and has raised the standard for villains in cinema. The movie is for everyone of all races, political leanings or ages. This is first and foremost a fun movies. Veteran actors Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker, give stunning performances complimented by their younger counterparts Lupita, Danai and co.Black Panther is not perfect , its a 9/10, but I rated it 10 to counter the mass 1 star ratings. This is easily the best MCU movie ever.A Wakanda-ful movie. Black Panther takes the MCU to new heights.</review-text>

		<review-text>Believe the hype! This is one of the best movies Marvel has released. It has an incredible cast, great cinematography, and fun actions scenes, but what sets this movie apart is the fact that it's deeper than most other Marvel movies. This isn't some mindless action movie; this is a movie with a heart and message that was delivered brilliantly by Ryan Coogler. The best part of this movie is Michael B. Jordan. He delivered the best performance in any Marvel movie I've seen, and his character is also one of the best written characters I've seen in a superhero movie.</review-text>

		<review-text>Guys, I don't understand how the ratings are 1 and 3's I thought we were done with all that last year. For the first time in a long time I'm so happy of how they portrayed the character story in the MCU. The black panther was Lmost everything I dreamed of in a movie. The cinematography and the story line almost made me cry tears of Joy. I watched this movie and it's so hard to explain myself without talking about some scenes. There was just something to hold on to for every scene and all you could do was bold your breath. But I'll hold it in. I liked the fact that Chadwick boseman did an extremely good Job, and most of the casts. But I really didn't want to see Michael B Jordan in the movie cast. *I don't know why, but I feel there was something about him that didn't add up. (The forced Black American thing).
I would have prefered someone else. E.g the doctore from spartacus, or someone of that nature but I guess its because of the story line and all. Anyways, it's a 9.8 for me.</review-text>

		<review-text>This Marvel film lived up to its hype. A good intro film for the franchise. There was a lot of &quot;explaining&quot; dialogue in the beginning that you would normally find in a &quot;first of its series&quot; film. The actors embodied their characters, and the action scenes are to die for. I need to see it once or twice again as there was so much going on per scene to truly catch it all. From the production design to the score to the costume deisgn to the location casting and the fight scene choreography. This film had so much to offer. 10/10

The actors did a great job...the story line was not even a little bit believable. And I could do with a little less obvious racism in a movie...Even though the ending is a happy fest where we can all get along the racial parts are what some groups will latch onto as if it were a possible agenda to get behind.

		<review-text>Black Panther starts out promising with acting by Michael B. Jordan, Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong'o and many more but unfortunately starts to fall flat like most film within the MCU. The problems with this film are the same with many others in the MCU, They go on for longer than they have any right to do. Very weird editing, cinematography and really bad CGI that we will all probably laugh at in 5 years time.The biggest problem with this film come when just over half way through ( I think, It feels like 2 hours in) they change the main bad guy to Jordan's character but it should have been him from the start and really didn't come as a shock when it happened because Serkis's character just feels weird in this film.

		<review-text>It is clearly not the best marvel movie but still a watchable one. I'll put down into small points listing the pros and cons of the film.1. Accent issues - it was quite hard to understand what the characters were saying. 
2. Acting - some characters were just funny when they said a dialogue. It could have been better for sure. Well, not as in all the characters were funny. Some of them did their part quite well. 
3. Impact - What I felt was the film did not have the right impact on the audience as they do in every marvel movie. This movie just felt unfinished. 
4. Story line - Well that is one thing I loved about the movie so much. The story was really great. It was far better than a lot of other superhero movies. If you are a marvel fan, you should watch this one to get to know Wakhanda and where the Black Panther comes from. Overall it was alright! Not a bad one. People definitely had a lot more expectations and it has just been overhyped that way. Don't listen to people who have been saying it is worst marvel movie or the best one. I would just say it was a fine movie. Not the worst but not the best too. Get some popcorn and enjoy your time without expecting too much from it.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is the eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the sixth film in Phase 3 of the series. Directed by Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station, Creed), it sets the bar to an all time high for Marvel films and provides a brilliant lead-in to Avengers: Infinity War.Shortly after the events of Captain America: Civil War, T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) returns to his country of Wakanda in Africa to be crowned as its new King. However, upon arriving home, T'Challa finds his position as King challenged by a old enemy whose intentions are far more sinister than merely seizing leadership over Wakanda and its citizens.Featuring some of the best written supporting characters and action scenes in a Marvel film, Black Panther is a benchmark in the series and is easily one of its best standalone films. The film's world building element showcases the vibrant and futuristic look of Wakanda, a fictional African country proudly entrenched its heritage and tradition. We also gain a somewhat James Bond/Jason Bourne vibe from the film at times, with its spy thriller elements and exciting car chases. Director Ryan Coogler does a suburb job fleshing out the main villain Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), whose motives go beyond merely world domination and lust for power. Chadwick Boseman is fantastic as the title character, the serious but kindhearted King who only wants what is best for his people, as was briefly touched on in Captain America: Civil War. Like with every other film in the series, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.I rate it 8.5/10</review-text>

		<review-text>The whole setting of the movie was very well planned! Humor passes here and there and definitely adds to the movie! Man , the VFX looked so awesome I felt like they were real! Flaws comes around sometimes during the movie. The plot started out fantastically but the conclusion was a bit unrealistic and was the only major downer. If you conclude yourself to watching this movie, you'll definitely notice whats missing and whats overdone.Overall, I'll definitely recommend this movie to people whos looking for an interesting sci-fi adventure with humor in it! Although I wouldn't prefer to watch several times, the 2h 14m felt like 50 minutes! This MCU movie stands out as a great start for 2018</review-text>

Is the movie too long or slow? NO
Are the characters awesome? YES (though a little generic)
Is the cinematography great? YES
Is the set design terrific? YES
Does it have a good story? IT DEPENDS The story is probably the weakest aspect because it's not really new (but let's be honest, new stories are rare, everything is somehow a variation of something). Many things are predictable (like in other Marvel movies) but that doesn't spoil the fun. The mixture of traditional African influences with modern technology is awesome though. Some ignorant person called Africa a &quot;sh*thole&quot;, this movie is a prophetic re-imagining of Africa.I wish some characters would have had more screen time but you can't have it all.Now go and see the movie!</review-text>

		<review-text>It's quite funny to read so many derogatory reviews by Imdb users about this movie. Once seen it's obvious that they write it from a political agenda or from a very limited interest in entertainment movies or, worst, from a racist or sexist point of view.
I don't think that Black Panther is the best superheroe movie ever (The Dark Knight or The Avengers or Spiderman 2 are better from MHPOV) nor the most funny (Guardians of the Galaxy or Thor Ragnarok or Deadpool would be) nor the most entertaining (here the list could be longer including some of the previous titles I've mentioned) but I think that it could be considered the most serious take for a superheroe mainstream movie. 
The beginning of the movie with the not much subtle message of Wakanda First! and how this evolve for the main character along the story (whose end of evolution is certified in the first extra scene after the main credits) clearly tries to send a message to the trumpists (and probably a lot of them are reviewing very low the movie) Also it tries to send a message of reconciliation to those that want to revive the ala &quot;Malcom X&quot; ideology or revanchist actions (here one has to think about the riots caused by some judicial decissions when police officers killed some black people or due to the move away of Southern symbols) portrayed by Killmonger. Probably some machist and alpha males (maybe a lot of them lovers of the macho image that superheroes use to portray) could feel that a so equal depiction of women and men as Warriors (yes with capital!, leaded by Nakia and Okoye) or scientists (the perfectly seized and restrained funny Shuri) or whatever, threatens their comfort zone. It has a good story and as well structured as a perfectly narrated story has to; the hero has to suffer a change and it happens thanks to the lesson he learns from his antagonist. The perfect simbiosis of the two faces of human personality by the hero and his opposite.
Naturally this is a Marvel and Disney movie and these companies are not going to create a manifesto or a propaganda film hence they don't dig in those topics as an independent movie would do. Killmonger character lacks of a wider development and the talent of Michael B Jordan deserved it and the myth of Klaw in the comic books is roughly severed in behalf of the narrative but despite everything I think that being an entertaining production it offers much ideas than we are used to and as much as expected in terms of joy and fun.</review-text>

As a Chinese Canadian who sat in a theater with mostly non-black audiences, the film reaffirmed our moral and political sensibilities in the most effective way possible.

		<review-text>Black Panther is the newest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Chadwick Boseman reprises his role from Captain America Civil War. The rest of the picture also features an great ensemble of well known actors. These include Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis. All of whom give serviceable performances. After the events of Civil War, T'Challa (Boseman) returns to his home Wakanda, a land that is deeply hidden within the African forest. Wakanda has been hidden from the majority of the world for centuries, Challa has to make a choice when an unexpected enemy comes to take his place. Boseman plays Challa / Black Panther with a mixture of wisdom, patriotism but also a lack of experience when it comes to the world. This is a interesting combination that really pays off when T'Challa meets with the main villain of the film played by Michael B. Jordan. The idea of a advanced culture with innovative technology that remains hidden from the world is very interesting. The majority of people from Wakanda believe that this makes the world a better place. However when Killmonger shows up these ideas are challenged through his character. Killmonger is the best villain the MCU has had since Loki, this is because both T'Challa and Killmonger can learn a lot from each other. This aspect is easily the best thing about Black Panther, unfortunately the film only becomes compelling after we pass the first act. The first act consists of a generic superhero plot in which T'Challa and his team race after Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) in order to capture him. This is important for the story in the long run but left me very emotionally empty. It also gives very little attention to Killmonger who only becomes interesting after the first hour. There is plenty of humour in Black Panther, the best jokes in the film came from Shuri (Letitia Wright) who plays the sister of T'Challa. She added plenty of self awareness that made myself and the all of the audience roar in the theatres. Unfortunately Black Panther also suffers from the same issues that Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2 and Thor Ragnarok suffered from and that is the fact that jokes are implemented in the wrong scenes. Sometimes a scene is meant to be serious until a character cracks a joke killing the impact of the scene. The action scenes also let me down, most of the them were too cgi heavy and I would've prefered some more realistic stunt work (but that's personal taste), especially because the director's previous film Creed had one of the sleekest looking fight scenes of recent years. Many of the special effects in Wakanda also felt unfinished, the look itself were breathtaking. However there were many set pieces that felt incomplete and too cartoony. The costumes and music of the film is terrific though, they really give this exotic african feel, it makes the film a lot more authentic. After the first hour passed, I really enjoyed this picture. There were some minor gripes with special effects and tone, but for the most part I had a lot of fun with it.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther was amazing. The idea of it itself is amazing but the film is also a sight to behold. It's not a perfect movie by any stretch, but how many perfect films are there. We get a Marvel villian that actually has a legit motivation and can be sympathized with. Killomger is the most compelling Marvel villain since Loki. The film was stunning visually and all the characters were lovable. I am excited for the future of this franchise and expect at least 2 more films in addition to Wakanda's large role in the upcoming Avenger's film. Wakanda Forever!</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther was pretty great and it avoids most of the problems that plague many of Marvel's other movies. It has a unique story to tell and does the best it can to tell that story instead of wasting its time serving as a trailer for future Avengers movies. It uses humor wisely and does not kill several dramatic or intense scenes by throwing in a cheap joke. It lets the emotional moments sink in, and does not try to undercut them.The villain is a fully realized character with an understandable motivation, and he has personal ties to our hero. Great. We need more believable antagonists like this! In fact, pretty much all of the characters - even the supporting ones - were fleshed out and given time to shine. The worldbuilding was also well done and most people will leave the movie wishing they could go to the country of Wakanda. 8/10.Black Panther does not reach the heights of comic book masterpieces like The Dark Knight or Logan, but I'd say it's a cut above most of the superhero movies that came out last year, including Thor Ragnarok, Spider-man Homecoming, Wonder Woman, Gaurdians of Galaxy 2 and the horrid Justice League (hatethatmovie).</review-text>

		<review-text>With the glut of superhero movies being released in theatres, one of the things that I credited movies like Deadpool and Logan for was trying to tell a more personable story. It doesn't have to be about saving the world, just introduce some characters we can enjoy following and provide some motivation we can relate to. Black Panther centres around the rivalry/conflict between T'Challa and Killmonger and I think that's an interesting choice. Killmonger is a shadowy version of what T'Challa could have been and the movie brings you along with their new king's struggle to understand his father's and his uncle's actions. But the important thing about this is you understand the differing perspectives of the characters and while you're cheering for T'Challa, you can at least understand where Killmonger is coming from. Their situation doesn't come with an easy answer and this problem compounds T'Challa's other issues (dealing with the death of his father, the responsibilities of running Wakanda, Nakia not reciprocating his affection for her etc.). The character development in this movie was pretty good and I appreciated the effort put in that way.The strength of this movie is that its effective in bringing you into this new and exciting environment. The kingdom of Wakanda is beautiful and is a pleasant change of pace for a Marvel movie. They play up the more traditional aspects of life in Africa while providing a new spin on it. It makes it easier to digest some bits of exposition and I would credit Coogler and his team for doing something off-beat. The cinematography was excellent, and the special effects were first rate. Couple that with some interesting technology and gadgets for our heroes and villains to interact with, there are few scenes where they don't utilize something fun to punch up the action or even the drama.This movie is populated by accomplished actors and actresses, but I was legitimately surprised on who impressed me the most. Chadwick Boseman is a star on the rise. He's got a lot of ability and charisma and while I enjoy his more dramatic performances (Marshall and 42) he slips into Black Panther with ease. Michael B. Jordan had a lot of energy in his performance and he was obviously giving it his all. He's a lot better in this compared to the Fantastic 4 but he was still bordering on overacting for me. I would give him credit for being one of the more impactful Marvel villains of recent memory. Andy Serkis is having a blast in the other villainous role as Ulysses Klaue. He's an awesome actor who doesn't get his due. Daniel Kaluuya was good after his breakout in Get Out, he's very measured here and strong. It was fun to see Lupita Nyong'o, she owned her scenes completely. Letita Wright gave one of the funnier performances in the film as T'Challa's sister Shuri. My favourite performance came from Danai Gurira as General Okoye. She sold all her scenes; her character has a strict code of honour that came across well in her acting. She is passable as a military leader (which is no mean feat) and yet there were some moments in the movie where she managed to be funny as well. She was very well rounded and deserves credit in her supporting role.One of the reasons that this movie will be so popular is that it is promoting diversity. We don't get many African-American superheroes (let alone a superhero from Africa) so it is important to get them right when they get the chance. Black Panther tackles this challenge as well as they could have. Not only is the story interesting and the actors/actresses are clearly on their game, but they incorporate how difficult it can be to come from the background that these fictional characters come from. It is not only addressed but it is at the forefront and they don't falter. I guess that shouldn't be a surprise considering who is involved with this project, but it is worth mentioning nonetheless.The biggest problem that this movie suffered from isn't even the fault of the people who made it. The hype surrounding Black Panther got a little out of control. Is this a good movie? Absolutely. Is it one of the better standalone Marvel films? You can absolutely make that argument. Best Marvel movie ever? For me, not even close. It absolutely deserves praise for the things that it gets right but people need to calm down a little. I would put this firmly in the middle somewhere, Marvel is the victim of continued success that way so simply making a good film doesn't qualify as doing something amazing for the studio (a comparison I would use is A Bug's Life or Brave, both are good movies but compared to the rest of Pixar's output, neither are exceptional). I had a couple of smaller issues, the action was very middle of the road, I didn't find a show-stopping moment in any of the fight scenes. Some of the characters arcs weren't satisfying, I feel like the only reason Martin Freeman's Everett Ross was included was to connect to the rest of the MCU, he had little to do on his own.Another few months go by and another exciting/action-packed movie put out by Marvel Studios. This has become the norm and while some people are growing sick of it, if they keep putting out quality material, I'm open to it. Black Panther isn't the second coming for comic book movies but that shouldn't detract from the fact this is a great movie. I would give this an 8.5/10 but I can't quite give it a 9/10. So, I have to go with an 8/10, I would recommend this to comic and non-comic fans alike.</review-text>

		<review-text>Marvel's Black Panther is one of those movies that's a game changer for the Black community. It is the first-ever comic superhero movie that features a black person as the lead role (not counting Hancock, as that was not based off a comic book). It features a predominately black cast, and was directed by a black man, Ryan Coogler. It breaks some media stereotypes about black people, and it's really something. If you haven't seen it, you should ASAP. It is simply breathtaking, especially in 3D. The movie might be one of the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it's going to be hard to top this.</review-text>

		<review-text>Every time a MCU film comes out, critics hail it as &quot;Marvel's best film yet&quot; only for me to find it either good/average (Civil War) or complete trash (Thor: Ragnarok). So, when critics were calling Black Panther the best MCU film, thankfully, I didn't put much stock into it because I don't think it's Marvel's &quot;best&quot;; that title still belongs to Winter Soldier...BUT I freaking loved the movie; it's definitely in my top 5 MCU films (maybe top 3 but I have to see it again before I can make that decision). The good: it showcased an African nation with different tribes, that were technologically advanced, and had their own natural resources that the world has never seen before. That's significant to me because a lot of African nations were stripped of their natural resources centuries ago, so to see this on screen was a breath of fresh air as was seeing African royalty as opposed to the usual impoverished Africans, gangsters, slaves, thugs, drug dealers etc... The performances were amazing...Boseman was great as usual but the stand outs for me were Letitia Wright (Shuri) and Danai Gurira (Okoye); I'm glad my daughter gets to see 2 strong, intelligent black females on screen. Jordan was a cool villain (a lot better than most of those crappy Marvel villains); I can always appreciate when you can hate a villain's actions but empathize with their motives. The bad: the CGI was rough in a lot of places and some of the action pieces were very muddled. There were a few slow areas, but I often find that happening with origin stories, so I can overlook that. Overall, I really dug this film; for now, I'll give it an 8/10 but that could change upon 2nd viewing. Bravo to Ryan Coogler and his team!!!</review-text>

		<review-text>If there is anything that makes you more happier than watching a marvel movie first day-first show, then this film is for you. Just a humble reminder, this review is SPOILER FREE,so read along.
Firstly, you aren't a true marvel fan if you are reading this, but if you are not sure and are confused about the mixed reception this movie is getting, then may be you should consider going through this article.
CAST-
The casting, as every other marvel film is just perfect. Chadwick Boseman, who was last seen dawning the black panther outfit in Captain America- Civil war has done justice to the role, and we all loved his performance as king of Wakanda. Micheal Jordon who plays the lead antagonist in the film is rumoured to be the best marvel villain after Loki (and of course excluding the titan Thanos) but I would like to disagree. The role did demand a level of seriousness, but I loved Andy Serkis as Klaw.He did cracked us up with his great coming timing and funny behaviour.Coming to the female lead Nupita Nyong'o, am I the only one or she really looks similar to Jennifer Lawrence? The rest of the cast faithfully presented as their respective soles demanded.The writers did an amazing job in telling us a story of Wakanda, and linking it to El dorado. It does gets a bit predictable at times, but you do have a good share of scenes where you involuntarily will go &quot;Ohhhhhs&quot; &amp; &quot;Ahhhhhhs&quot;.
The action scenes are few but brilliantly executed,and the Wakandan empire, the most advance country in marvel cinematic universe does blow your mind with all its science and technology.I can identify why people are not appreciate the movie and the ratings are also not what it deserved. The first one being inadequate action (perhaps?). The trailer packed us all with loads of excitement,but the movie was more of a great plot and drama but a bit less of action. Also, there are obviously going to be comparison between this movie and the last marvel film, Thor-Ragnarok. The third instalment for the Thor series, is considered,by far, the best marvel film ever, and mainly due to its superb comic timing. Black panther too does boast scenes which tickle your funny bone, but we also need to understand that this is the first Black panther stand alone movie, and considering that the movie is fit to be called a blockbuster. Not to forget what marvel movies are famous for, a good Stan Lee cameo and a post credit scene as well, which I not going to reveal.DO NOT READ this paragraph if you haven't watched the movie till now.
The greatest disappointment was that there was no sign of the soul stone. There were a lot of valid arguments and speculations about soul stone to be introduced in this movie, which didn't come true.My conclusion is that no matter what the world thinks,this is a marvel film and YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!!</review-text>

		<review-text>In the latest production from Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), we see the original story of the Black Panther. We were introduced to the Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. This film depicts the story of King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) and the Black Panther tribe. 
 
When T'Challa returns home to the reclusive, beautiful and technologically impressive nation of Wakanda, a fictional country in Africa, he is named the new leader following the death of his father. True to custom, he is challenged by the tribesman and becomes the new King. Elsewhere, a cousin unknown to him returns from the United States to challenge T'Challa's reign, and chaos ensues. Warmonger (Michael B Jordan) and his political beliefs are diabolical and the opposite of T'Challa's. As foes set forth to destroy Wakanda, Black Panther teams up with a C.I.A. agent and a neighboring tribe to prevent the country from a world war. The path from light to dark, and back to doing good in the world beyond Wakanda is refreshing.The film is pure Marvel action-adventure with a broad political and socially aware feeling. It is awake and unique. It may be a superhero film, yet it is also steeped in real political and social issues similar to those we face today, especially diversity and inclusion. The strong female characters - Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ramonda (Angela Bassett) are phenomenal. 
 
I love this film! From the casting, cinematography and directing, to the special effects and female empowerment, it is fulfilling. The action is believable, many of the fight scenes are based on African martial arts, although the CGI at times is a little whack. Overall, I was displaced, forgetting I was sitting in a theater. The costumes are fantastic with attention to detail befitting royalty. Wakanda forever!I give this film 5 out of 5 stars for the cast, social and political awareness, technology focus and female empowerment. This film will appeal to ages 10 to 18, as well as adults. I caution younger viewing due to fight scenes which may be disturbing.Reviewed by Kimbirly O., KIDS FIRST! Juror. </review-text>

		<review-text>This movie had amazing cinematography, the cast was phenomenal, and it was a beautiful experience. I wouldn't call it a &quot;black movie&quot; and just label it like that. It was a genuinely good superhero movie. Michael B. Jordan was SO good as Kilmonger and by the end of the movie you really do sympathize with him (just as you did with Loki) Really loved Leticia's Shrui and Duke's Baku, both brought the classic Marvel humor. As an asian, I really think its important to see all types of people in pop culture. Again there is no such thing as race, we are all human. Growing up watching Disney princess movies, I would always play Jasmine since she looked the most like me (I'm still growing up) but its so important for kids to see heroes who look like them. Wonder Woman was also really great because I saw a badass female superhero and it really did feel good. I would definitely recommend this movie!! Negatives: I wish the movie paced properly, the start was kind of slow and then the end was way too fast. I wish more songs from the soundtrack were included</review-text>

		<review-text>I went into this movie, with a lot of background excitement. Although not in Hong Kong particularly, the buzz of this movie on Twitter was one that was overwhelming to be honest. I think what I liked about the film in the beginning, is the way they connected T'Challa and T'Chaka in a deeper sense, when compared to the brief moment in Civil War. I think they truly gave Black Panther a good and proper origin, however it didn't feel like the one Dr Strange got in his own movie. This origin story, was more like experiencing T'Challa in depth after a brief and fast introduction in CA: Civil War.Why I felt this movie was the most relatable MCU Movie, is because of the customs and the attire. As an Indian, born and brought up in India, some dressing sense and ornaments felt very known to me. For example, T'Challa in one of his scenes wears a clothing item, very similar to the Kurta (Search Google, basically an Indian long garment). Also, some rituals were something that I could easily make sense of.After Loki, Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger felt like a really great villain in the MCU. I won't be spoiling his story, but one has to experience him on their own to know what I mean. His scenes are to watch out for, you would be greatly influenced by his character.The women in this movie are a talking point on themselves,but two that caught my eyes were: Danai Gurira's Okoye and Letitia Wright's Shuri. Shuri, in particular, was one of favourite characters in the movie. Interestingly, Okoye and Shuri are two women in charge of defense and technological innovation respectively. I just felt, so happy that they portrayed both the physical and mental capabilities of the women. Saying any further will spoil the movie, so that's it.However, the only reason I will give it a 9, is because the approach towards the climax, for me, felt a bit over-stretched. Otherwise, an all and all amazing movie, with a lot of socio-political facts surrounding it, that will be talked by generations to come by.Hope this review was helpful.Dharya P.</review-text>
		<review-title>The Most Relatable Marvel Movie I have ever watched</review-title>

		<review-text>Not only was Black Panther a film technically well-made - from the research, storytelling, visual effects, and, especially, the soundtrack - but Black Panther also made an impact. Despite some reviews calling it quite too ambitious (a fact that I did not see at all), it understood its role within the MCU and, quite obviously, society, which left moviegoers exiting the theaters with an agreeable praise. Personally, the best opinion that I have of Black Panther is that it had a plethora of great balance. It invited us into a world filled with African tradition while adding sci-fi nuances; I felt like I learned about classic African culture while simultaneously discovering advanced technology unlike anything I've seen before. The story was well-paced and did not, for one second, waste the potential of any of the characters. There were many players introduced into this complex story, but they all had a voice to play - just as we do - in a world crumbling due to political tensions (something quite prominent in this film haha) and a kingdom divided by a tradition and progress. In fact, I think the abundance of characters each holding onto what's important to them in such contentious times is what simplified the story. Each person eventually came to an internal understanding of their roles within Wakanda, which helped center the story back to King T'Challa. In turn, this leaves more gravitas on his controversial decisions as a new king.Killmonger (especially) is a character that lingers in my brain because he really embodies the victimized portrayal of &quot;the villain is the hero in his own story&quot;. Despite being extremely belligerent and confrontational, he was a villain who is more centered than the average politician and has more purpose than many current world leaders. His arguments held truth, and I am 99% sure that the only reason that his ideals weren't executed was because he was too aggressive and not diplomatic enough. Killmonger makes a GREAT antihero to the untried King T'Challa because he made the newly crowned, untried, and demure T'Challa open his eyes to lives of the other 2 billion black people in the world. Consequently, this resolved T'Challa's inner strength and made him more politically adept; ironically, I'll even argue that Killmonger MADE his own foil by bringing out a diplomatic and resolute King T'Challa to Killmonger's brute and hostile nature. Killmonger left us with many thought-provoking statements about oppression, the role of blacks all over the world, and our duty as people (or kings) to help each other without being an overbearing character or compromising T'Challa's already burdened storyline on being a new king.In its own right, the film fits perfectly into our current societal climate and the Marvel Cinematic Universe - into this already complex sci-fi/magical world on the screen and the even more complicated world of reality.I could go on with the many, many well-executed aspects of this film. But just by watching the film, you don't need an overly long list or review to get the idea that because of the story, technical details, and a justified but respectful message, Black Panther definitely opens the identity of - and thus gives more voice to - modern black society.</review-text>

		<review-text>Hands down, this was head and shoulders above anything I expected from a superhero flick, and I say that as a long-time fan of both the MCU and X-Men franchises.The cast is incredibly talented--all of them do a fantastic job, and it's amazing to see such a diverse group of actors and actresses from all around the world. The conflict at the heart of the movie addresses a nuanced problem of respectability politics, radicalization, and the responsibility that governments and/or those with power, resources, and authority have toward those without. The solution isn't treated as 'easy' or simple, either. There are no robots to punch, no alien overlords to blame and triumph over in the third act. It's human against human, both sides of the conflict have real and valid reasons for their perspectives, and that human connection makes it so much stronger and more resonant and more poignant. I felt for Killmonger as much as I felt for T'Challa, Shuri, and the others.Furthermore, the many women of the film aren't there for window-dressing and eye candy and impossible T&amp;A-displaying back-bends. They're intelligent players, they're part of the story, they contribute with agency of their own and obviously have the respect of their male compatriots. They're neither made into aggressive, 'angry' caricatures, nor helpless fainting flowers. This is the kind of intersectionality we should be expecting in media.The setting and design and production of the film is superb on its own merits. The views of the capitol of Wakanda are brilliant--everything from the architectural designs of the structures, the materials used, all the way down to the written script and the gorgeous costuming and the way rooms are decorated and laid out is clearly and keenly not just following by rote repetition the same sort of skylines and designs you would expect to see in New York or London. There's a feeling of cultural weight, of history and time and the development of distinct values.I've watched it twice so far, may go back for a third, and will definitely be purchasing the DVD when it comes out. Please support this movie. Show the studios that we want more like this--diverse casts, excellent and thoughtful scripts, and conflicts that aren't afraid to touch on real-world issues that affect many of the people who will go to see these movies, in one way or another.</review-text>

		<review-text>The highly anticipated superhero film &quot;Black Panther&quot; is finally here, after a ton of hype and outstanding reviews. While I would say that the film very, very slightly does not quite live up to some of the hype, it is still well-made and thoroughly entertaining. The film's acting is stronger than one would come across in most superhero movies, highlighted by Chadwick Boseman's commanding and stylish performance as T'Challa (Black Panther.) Also noteworthy is Michael B. Jordan's role as the impressively complex villain, and the Dora Milaje--the all-female special forces unit of Wakanda (the fictional African country where much of the film takes place.)Speaking of Wakanda, director Ryan Coogler has masterfully designed and executed difficult world-building tactics to create this kingdom. The visual effects on display depicting Wakanda's unique landscapes are stunning, and it is genuinely impressive the detail that went into analyzing the kingdom's mercantile economy and political structure. Through depiction of a spear-fighting ritual as well as music, dance and food, audiences are immersed into the nation's local culture as well. These elements often make &quot;Black Panther&quot; feel more fresh than the typical superhero film.While there's undoubtedly much to like about &quot;Black Panther,&quot; the film does unfortunately contain some notable lapses. Its biggest flaw is that the climax of the movie is incredibly rushed and sometimes feels like it has trouble taking its time to tie up loose ends and plot holes. Conversely, the first act seems a bit too long. While the movie is generally well-written, the film's attempted moments of comic relief and one-liners that are effective in other Marvel movies tend to fall a bit flat here. That said, this is still a good and unique superhero film that I do recommend. 7/10Note: I saw the film in IMAX. The film's frequent use (over an hour of footage worth) of special formatting for IMAX, as well as the screen size and sound system, made this premium experience worthwhile.</review-text>

		<review-text>I went into this movie with high expectations and was not at all disappointed! I loved it because it was so much more than a start to finish action packed thriller filled with explosions. It was a film, with a story that moved gracefully from scene to scene. Not to mention, the setting was breathtaking. Sure there was some slight CGI hiccups here and there and the villain could have acted some parts better, but the movie was so enjoyable that those things didn't matter to me at all.

		<review-text>&quot;Black Panther&quot; (PG-13, 2:14), debuting in the second month of 2018, is the 18th feature film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is the first MCU film featuring a predominantly black cast. It's focused on the titular comic book character who was introduced briefly in 2016's &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;. Building on that set-up, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) takes over for his deceased father as King of the fictional Wakanda and, with the title, inherits the abilities and responsibilities of the Black Panther.It appears that the most technologically advanced country on earth is not the U.S. or any country in Asia, but is that nation in central Africa which has been able to develop incredible technology from a rare metal which is found nowhere else on the planet (which also helps the country to remain hidden from the rest of the world, which assumes Wakanda to be just another Third World nation in Africa). In the midst of their high degree of development, the people maintain their ancient culture and traditions which, in this film, represent a rich array of real-world influences from peoples across the continent. Now that he is the king, T'Challa is responsible for safe-guarding Wakanda's unique capabilities from falling into the hands of evil doers from the outside world. (You know what they say, with great technology comes great responsibility... or something like that.) To do his job, T'Challa sometimes must become the Black Panther and use an impressive array of gadgets developed by his sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright), who is best described as MCU's Tony Stark meets James Bond's &quot;M&quot;. Backing up T'Challa is a formidable army led by female warriors like Okoye (Dania Gurira) and loyal officials like Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya), a spiritual leader called Zuri (Forest Whitaker) and T'Challa's mother, Ramonda (Angela Bassett). T'Challa is going to need help from all of them (as well as from neighboring tribes and even a CIA officer, played by Martin Freeman) if he's going to stand against the likes of the evil Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and the lethal and power-hungry Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan).&quot;Black Panther&quot; is unique and terrifically entertaining. It fits nicely into the MCU canon, but still charts a course all its own. Its hero is every bit as able and impressive as any other MCU character. As in the plot of most superhero movies, lives are in danger and the fate of the world hangs in the balance, but in a new and creative way. The stakes may be the same, but the tone is different - because of the film's Africa-centric setting - but also in the issues raised and the questions asked. Enhancing it all, we get exciting action, terrific visuals and awe-inspiring cinematography, not to mention a fantastic cast which includes several Oscar winners and Oscar nominees. This a Marvel movie through-and-through (complete with Stan Lee cameo and cross-pollinating end-credits scene), but it's one of the most fully-realized and enjoyable MCU cinematic achievements to date. &quot;A&quot;</review-text>

		<review-text>T'Challa(Boseman, charismatic, not mistaking considering issues for being indecisive) returns to his homeland of Wakanda to succeed his late father as king after the latter's sudden murder. Will he continue the way things have worked for centuries, or go down a different path? How does one best aid one's own people? And does that extend beyond your nation's borders? Can he stop Killmonger(B. Jordan, passionate, wrong only in how far he goes and not in what he seeks to solve), before he tears the country apart from within?This shares a lot of traits with The Wonder Woman solo movie. It's about time that they are made. but being filmed now, they can use recent events, and the franchise they belong to, to great effect. They celebrate, not excuse, not mock, not downplay, the traits typically thought of as natural, or even culturally, historically, geographically, important to the minority that they're about. They're telling a story important to that group. Exploring themes specific to them. Presenting a fictional, powerful country, where they are in charge, they are the rule rather than the exception, and govern by their strengths. And now to get into what separates this from the Gal Gadot-led picture, and I'm not saying that movie could have, or should have, done this, as it is, intentionally, a different story. That is about a woman on her own, in a world dominated by men. This is fully immersed in African culture. It is relevant to black people in the US, and all over the world. But it's not about immigrants, or their descendants. Which is not to say that it's snobby. Free of the pressures of the majority of the population who are distinct from them, never made to be ashamed of who they are, The Five Tribes do have all the power that their kin continue to fight for as they have for hundreds of years. In fact, far more than that. And so, it asks, how do you use that? What makes a great leader?All the visuals are dazzling. Costumes, sets, designs, cinematography, etc. The acting is great. Shuri(Wright, infectious smile, casual, a brilliant engineer) steals every scene she's in. Coogler, known for drama, of course handles that aspect with a deft hand. And unusually for a first-time Blockbuster director, also the action, scope and massive budget. A little of the coverage and editing is awkward, showing his inexperience. but that is barely noticeable. The James Bond meets The Godfather feel blends the classic with the ultra-modern perfectly. The ancestral plane seems made for going into father son relationships. The War rhinos(!) Are an inspired touch. This is full of black women. They aren't looked down on, or angry side-kicks. Several are serious bad-asses. They give the protagonist advice, from their different perspectives, and he considers all of it. My only real complaint is that this did not take the final step in making this completely accessible for those unfamiliar with the MCU. If you did not watch the film that introduces the Black Panther, you will not understand, as this does not retell, what happened after the explosion that hits the UN. And since going blind into that film is even more confusing(If you watch Age of Ultron before it, you can follow it no problems... but not everybody knows that), that means this can't be watched by everyone. So I urge you. If you didn't already, catch those two films first, then go see this . Obviously, not everyone has, or will, see all 17 leading up to this.There is some violence and strong language in this. I recommend this to everyone. I give this a perfect rating not to even out the overall score, a practice I do not believe in, but because it deserves it. I reserve that for only the best. I give it rarely. And I am thrilled to award it to this. 10/10</review-text>

		<review-text>After thinking Thor: Ragnorok wasn't really worth my efforts, I was so happy with this instalment from Marvel. I hope they don't get bright and get a new director for subsequent BP films that turns it into everything i disliked in Thor as well as GOTG. I cannot fault Black Panther - it even inspired me to want to shave my head for a moment (then sense took over). It was a beautiful film. Women rock. I loved the rituals. I loved the fact it incorporated fashions from all over Africa - but Tchaka wore Ntoma from Ghana worthy of a King. At my viewing there was a round of applause.But the best bit was seeing the look of delight on my friend's daughter who was allowed to stay up post bed time to watch BP. She was captivated. To all the naysayers, if they could see the looks of amazement that girls and boys alike will have as they watch, then they may take several seats.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is a great movie with an excellent storyline. Each is entitled to their own opinion, but I am curious regarding the real agenda of those who are rating it with low scores. The movie is no more political or controversial than any other movie shown in a theater over the last half century. The dialog is often thought provoking and may generate some discussion because it acknowledges some of the world's social issues. It is action-packed and mostly family friendly. The fight scenes are typical for super hero films and the CGI is pretty good. Women and many other minorities have significant screen time and major roles in the development of the plot. The lead actors stars give the supporting cast room to share the spotlight. I highly recommend all DC and Marvel fans to see this movie and incorporate it into the debates and discussions about super heroes and villains. I expect many of these stars to show up again on the silver screen soon.</review-text>

		<review-text>After reading all the great feedback this movie got, I was shocked to see what a piece of nothing it was. Felt like they took a huge bucket and put everything in it: bad jokes (plenty), bad acting, boring scenes, sf, powerful weapons, voodoo, good FX, bad FX, drama, good acting ( Andy Serkis ), oh and all the dancing and the colors... It had 2 or 3 good ( great ) scenes, I want to highlight the car chase and the prison part. It could have gone nicely from there, but no, you had to blew it. They are talking about the most advanced technology and weapons, but they are fighting with spears and a blanket...oh and Jordan is trash, with the attitude, didn't fit the movie at all. I was expecting Timon and Pumba to show up, and smoke something with Jordan's kid while they sing &quot;HAKUNAMTATAH&quot;. I know 3/10 is harsh but so is my patience with bad movies.</review-text>

		<review-text>T'Challa, after the death of his father, the King of Wakanda, returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation to succeed to the throne and take his rightful place as king. Black Panther has some good moments of pure joy like the 3rd act which is awesome, the costumes, the characters and the acting from Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Forest Whitaker and the rest of the Cast and Crew for a majority of the film was good (except Andy Serkis who was terrible especially when he started singing and Daniel Kaluuya who seemed like the basic racist pal that doesn't belong in this Franchise) now speaking of SJW this film has a line where Killmonger's plan is to arm all black people around Earth so to go against their enemies which is white people and others of race and culture now did someone in the Marvel office took that as a good idea? I mean that's a terrible plan, a racist plan and above all? something that should and will make people mad and they have every right to, the cgi? for an 18th entry in the Series? they look pretty terrible especially the fights between T'Challa and Killmonger or that entire scene with the Rhinos and that scene in the Cliff jeez, also the movie goes from Black Panther to become Arrow Season 3 when T'Challa gets overpowered and gets thrown from the cliff it was a piece by piece copy of that scene from Arrow and also the humor? it was terrible like for instance the scene with the flip floppers? or Serkis singing? who even came with those scenes in the first place? Black Panther is not a complete garbage film but it's a mess of a film that has issues with it's effects, it's villain's motivations and terrible jokes that don't land at all. Now no offense but Blade and Blade II were much better movies as a whole and without politics in them as well. This movie is no 'Thor: Ragnarok' but it ain't no 'Winter Soldier' either and please don't believe the hype it's not Marvel's best it's easily their most mediocre entry to date and let's hope that Avengers: Infinity War ain't like that.

		<review-text>Finally the first the major release of 2018 is here in the form of Marvel Studios' Black Panther, which is the first comic-book movie based on a colored superhero. Co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler, this is a bold and mostly fresh take on the superhero genre. With all the hype being built around the movie, you may be asking, does it live up to it? The answer is, mostly. The events of Black Panther take place shortly after &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;, where T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns home to Wakanda to become the new king after the unfortunate death of his father. But the problem is that T'Challa doesn't believe that he is ready to follow in his father's footsteps and be as great of a leader as him, which creates some conflict within himself. This conflict and self-doubt however, must be put aside when a mercenary named Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) threatens to sell Wakanda's secret resource, vibranium, on the black market. T'Challa also has to deal with someone by the name of Erik Stevens aka Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), who has a surprising backstory that gives some depth to the character, which actually makes him a decent villain overall. Unlike most comic-book movies with multiple villains, this one handles them really well and never lets them make the story too convoluted, which can be credited to the writing by Coogler and Joe Robert Cole. This is by far one of the most mature Marvel movies ever made and part of that is because of the performances by a talented cast that has a mix of veterans and newcomers. Boseman holds his own as T'Challa, Michael B. Jordan is solid as the main villain, and even Forest Whitaker brings something to the table as Zuri, one of the elders of Wakanda. The scene stealer here however is Letitia Wright, who plays T'Challa's sister, Shuri, who is basically the brains behind all of the advanced medical and warfare equipment that Wakanda has. It helps that she and Boseman have good chemistry with one another, making the brother and sister relationship that they have in the movie believable. What also makes this movie more mature than other Marvel films is the themes that it touches on. Some of the themes include racial, moral, and political issues that really make this movie seem a bit less like a typical action-packed superhero movie. The action scenes that are present in the movie are fine and exactly what you would expect, but the emphasis here is on the characters and themes.Even though it is a more mature piece of work when compared to the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it still has that same formulaic and predictable plot that plagues almost every superhero movie these days, especially the Marvel ones. It even got to the point where towards the final act of the movie, I predicted exactly how everything was going to play out and sure enough, I was right. It's just your typical rise, fall, and rise again storyline that features a hero of some sort. But perhaps this is the problem with solo superhero movies that are set in cinematic universes, you already know which characters can and can't die, and this leads to the movies having the same predictable plot line that we've seen over and over again, and Black Panther is no exception. It's the only real major weakness of the film, but it's a big one.All in all, Black Panther delivers an origin story that is more grounded in its characters and themes compared to most other comic-book movies, which was definitely something refreshing to experience. It's not this masterpiece that many claim it to be, but if you can get past its formulaic and predictable plot, you may find yourself smiling throughout this journey all the way up until Infinity War in May.</review-text>

		<review-text>A film full of culture, own style. A solid story; of political and racial conflicts. Visually beautiful, excellent costumes, Wakanda feels totally real and beautiful, the CGI of the film is excellent except in some places. 
Our characters are incredible: Lettita Wright as Shuri gives us that comic-sarcastic touch totally of the MCU, Lupita Nyong'o gives us a warrior totally loyal to her nation, Michel B. Jordan as Killmonger us one of the best villains of the MCU, with good motivations, which make the viewer doubt if in reality he is on a good path. Chadwick Boseman is excellent as Black Panther to whom we see him defending his nation, and upholding his beliefs and decisions.
In particular, the film is excellent breaking the mold of the latest films of the MCU, has a serious tone, action at the most, and a good subject to reflect.
The only bad thing about the movie is that at the beginning it feels a bit slow, but when it is introduced, the story catches you and has a good development.</review-text>
		<review-title>Black Panther a movie with identity,</review-title>

	<review id="405">
		<review-text>There are some movies than mean more than just entertainment or insight in ones life. There are certain films that spark phenomenons for certain cultures in unexplainable ways while still maintaining the intent for enjoyment for others. Black Panther emerged from the Captain America: Civil War film and gave the audience only a feeling of what to expect from the land of Wakanda, but also brought the audience even more than one would expect from a Marvel movie.The film follows T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) as he takes the throne as king of Wakanda after the death of his father. As he returns home and settling within his position, he also comes across people who challenge his abilities as a king and the sins of his fathers past.Ryan Coogler as a director really delivers a gorgeous movie (his third film so far, Creed &amp; Fruitvale Station) and stage Wakanda beautifully from the world building to the eclectic costume design. The characters motivations feel sharper than ever, and never fears making references that make the audiences laugh and snap their fingers. Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) is one of the few MCU villains that has a believable motivation but a shockingly raw reason to his plan that many might find themselves asking the same thing.While the cinematography can be really good at times, it can be shaky at moments as well. The very first fight scene takes place in the dark, and with the gunfire and fast cutting, it can be a little shaky on the eyes at times deciphering whats happening. Also the CGI in some points, particularly in a &quot;Coming to America&quot; style christening, I felt a little deja vu from old cutout characters from old video games. And while there's more than enough action to spare in this film, I could have used a little bit of space in between each action scene.Black Panther nonetheless is still a very rousing kind of superhero movie that takes on a couple interesting themes. There's excitement, and really challenges the power dynamic when the shoe is on the other foot. Find the biggest screen you can and be ready to take a trip that you may not want to come back from.</review-text>

		<review-text>Right out of the gate, one of my favorite features of this film is how vibrantly colorful it is. So many of the MCU movies (and action movies in general) have a pretty dull color scheme with only the occasional pop of color. I enjoyed the large range of colors and patterns on display.I liked that most of the plotlines in the movie focused on personal relationships, and that so many of them were familial. T'challa and Shuri's interactions were adorable.Killmonger was an incredibly compelling and multi-dimensional villain.The various interactions between Shuri, Nakia, and Okoye were wonderful. Their personalities and personal relationships with each other felt fleshed out.The score for Black Panther was absolutely amazing.There were only two things that bugged me:1- Some of special effects did not look good and were in my opinion pretty noticeable. Such as, during T'challa's initial coronation ceremony, the crowds of people standing on the cliffsides didn't really blend well with the background. Several of the times that people got thrown during the final big fight scene weren't great either. etc.2- I with they had shown or said what the consequences were for W'Kabi's actions. I would have liked to know if he was in prison (I assume so), if the people that followed his charge were jailed or not since they were just following his orders (since I got the feeling they would have followed his orders regardless of if they agreed and if they would be punished accordingly or if would be less harsh since it would be seen more as fulfilling their duty to follow W'Kabi.). Regardless of what happened to W'Kabi, I would have also like to see if there would be any hint of a chance for redemption since he had such close relationships with several of the main characters.Regardless of these complaints, they weren't enough for me to knock off a star.</review-text>

		<review-text>I loved Shuri and the portrayal tribal rituals.
Humor hits sometimes. 
Movie gives a clear image of Wakanda.
Killmonger could have said more than just one liners.Some scenes were obvious green-screen and the CG fight was distracting and terrible (Is marvel getting lazy with it? I mean they have huge budgets for these movies and they still couldn't deliver a proper blend of real action and cgi like they did in some of their previous films)It was an alright movie, falls short by the third act. If you watch the trailer you kind of get the gist of the movie
Needs more Shuri.
Forgot to mention, this movie is completely unrelated to infinity war, no teasers even. They kind of baited us into watching this by showing scenes of wakanda in the infinity war trailer</review-text>

		<review-text>It should be said that all characters have been exquisitely cast. Chadwick remains a very strong Black Panther and the secondary characters are brought to live admirably. Especially Danai Gurira as Okoye and Letitia Wright, as his brilliant younger sister, shine in their parts.
The music is also really good, which gives you an extra reason to linger during the credits while you wait for the usual fun bonus.
Ludwig Goransson deserves all the praise because the orchestral music that blares during the exciting moments is also filled with African instruments. 
A very nice look at a superhero world in which African cultures are honoured. A good story about a prince who has to take on the role of a king and the change in the political climate.This movie differs from other MCU movies and it is close to &quot;CA:winter soldier&quot;,quality wise</review-text>

		<review-text>If you expect the same excitement, humour and action as in Thor, Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy or the Captain America movies you will be disappointed; however, if you are ready to give it a chance and see something different, you'll love it. I don't agree with those who said there was no great acting, the actors were brilliant, especially the women. Yes, it's true that politics was involved but I think in a good way, it conveyed a message which people in today's modern societies need. The visuals, the costumes were beautiful and the soundtrack too. The story was well written and there were surprising/unexpected elements as well. Only the beginning was a bit boring. I enjoyed it and would definitely watch it again just like any other Marvel movies. The 9/10 is because Loki was not in it.:( (Not that I expected him to be, but he's my absolute favourite villain:))))</review-text>

	<review id="415">
		<review-text>Superhero movies never get a fair shake. There's always been an invisible - but undeniable - whiff of critical disdain attached to films revolving around people with superhuman abilities. More often than not, these films are viewed (and assessed) as popcorn entertainment: good fun, but not objectively good. Even the best examples of the genre are rarely, if ever, taken seriously by critics or award shows. But all that is set to change with Black Panther - a bold, brilliant blockbuster teeming with ideas, characters and messages that will make your soul take flight. For once, it's no exaggeration to say that you've never seen or experienced anything like this before.The film gets off to a somewhat sedate start, as we're re-introduced to T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the freshly crowned King of Wakanda who is also infused with the ancestral powers of his nation's panther god. Writer-director Ryan Coogler takes his time in introducing us to all the key players in the film's first act, from the most important members of T'Challa's royal court to the rites, rituals and rigidity of Wakanda itself. It's never boring, but Black Panther does linger in a minor key for a while. You might find yourself wondering just where the film is going, as T'Challa deals with a challenge to his authority from within Wakanda's five tribes. It can be hard to imagine, too, just what the film wants to say when T'Challa - who could easily delegate the responsibility - takes it upon himself to personally hunt down dastardly arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) in order to retrieve a stolen artifact made of Wakanda's most precious natural resource, vibranium.But put your trust in Coogler - he's certainly earned it with his masterful blending of tension, character and story in his previous two films, Fruitvale Station and Creed. As Black Panther unfolds, everything starts to make a whole lot of sense, in dramatic, emotional and narrative terms. Suddenly, we're not just witnessing the growing pains of a new king. As it turns out, Black Panther is, for its titular character, an existential odyssey: as he fights for his nation's survival, T'Challa must also grapple with the choices (and sins) of his ancestors, deciding whether to embrace or reject them. Most significantly, Black Panther uses its blockbuster platform to examine complex issues such as racism and colonialism in thoughtful, intimate ways. The fiction of Wakanda - a hyper-evolved African nation that has kept its technological advances a secret from the rest of the world for centuries - allows Coogler to hold up a mirror to the facts of the world in which we live. In quite unprecedented fashion, we are presented with a host of proud, brave, indomitable African warriors who have lived their lives free of the horrors of slavery and institutionalised racism. Just as Wonder Woman gave little girls the world over a hero in their own image, Black Panther will do the same for generations of black children who have never before seen themselves represented on screen.If that sounds impossibly weighty and grim, don't worry. Coogler's script, co-written with Joe Robert Cole, is far from preachy. There may be a hint or two of hand-wringing melodrama to T'Challa's central dilemma - should Wakanda venture out into the world and lead by example? - but it's cleverly off-set by the depths of darkness and despair written into T'Challa's nemesis: Erik 'Killmonger' Stevens (Michael B. Jordan). Shaped by the very different circumstances of their lives, one man turns towards the light, and the other away from it - and yet, neither man falls simply into the black-and-white categories of 'hero' or 'villain'. Somehow, Coogler shades centuries of history and hope into the conflict at the heart of their troubled relationship.Black Panther is no slouch, either, when it comes to turning up the heat in terms of action and spectacle. There's a jaw-dropping car chase through the neon-washed streets of Busan that's easily one of the most exhilarating scenes you'll see all year. Fight scenes are pulled off with remarkable flair, particularly when it comes to the swift military precision of the Dora Milaje - an incredibly cool, all-female special forces unit devoted to the protection of Wakanda's monarch. Wakanda itself is an eye-popping fantasy scape: a heady blend of futuristic elements and African traditons, colours and music. Leading the film's top-notch ensemble, Boseman is the film's quiet backbone: an invaluable presence and the reason everything holds together at all. He shares an electric chemistry with Jordan, who blends swagger, menace and pathos in creating the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most complex, nuanced and sympathetic antagonist to date. Fantastic as the two leading men, however, they're not the breakout stars of the film. That honour belongs to a trio of female characters - each one given depth, layers and a fierce, real on-screen presence that's still rare enough that they shouldn't be taken for granted. Lupita Nyong'o injects strength and steel into her portrayal of Nakia - a former and future love interest for T'Challa who manages to be interesting in her own right. The Walking Dead's Danai Gurira is a force to be reckoned with as Okoye, the righteous leader of the Dora Milaje; while Letitia Wright's Shuri - T'Challla's younger sister who also happens to be Wakanda's premier scientist - waltzes away with every scene in which she appears.It may come as a surprise to some that Marvel's latest superhero blockbuster tackles issues of race, representation and discrimination in so bold and unflinching a manner. And yet, fans of the comic books that have inspired Marvel's entire slate of films would say: it's about time. In the way it embraces its story and heritage, in the way its heroes are presented, and in the way its message will inspire and empower generations to come, Black Panther matters. And it cannot - and will not - be ignored.</review-text>
		<review-title>This may be Marvel's 18th film, but it feels like the studio is just getting started. Brave and brilliant, this superhero movie is like nothing you've ever seen.</review-title>

		<review-text>Another MARVEL hero is here and this time it's not quite the usual stuff. Having been introduced in the Captain America: Civil War, the Wakandan prince returns to the big screen as Black Panther. This is not exactly an origin story, but it's more of a continued chapter of T'challa's life after Captain America: Civil War. The movie tells us the legend of Black Panther and the life in Wakanda which has distanced itself from the rest of the world. The metal, Vibranium plays an important part in all of this which itself is pursued by the evil arms dealer Ulysses Klaue. After his father's death at the UN bombing, T'challa has to prove his worth to the throne while he tries to rid of Ulysses Klaue for good. But the pursuit leads him to know the truth about his uncle and cousin. T'Challa has to protect the misuse of Wakandan resources by fighting his cousin Erik Killmonger who takes over Wakanda by defeating him in a fight. The plot of the movie is simple and also similar to many other superhero movies. However, the cultural and racial backdrop makes this movie very different from others. The city, Wakanda is one of the important aspect of the movie. It is technologically advanced than most part of the world and yet sticking to its cultural roots. Wakanda takes you to a different world altogether. This experience is enhanced by the background score which is very African and amazing costume design. Out of the very few scenes involving the outside world, the Seoul, action scene is a treat to watch. Black Panther lays out a perfect platform for the coloured actors in Hollywood to showcase their talents. Driven by the commercial power of MARVEL Cinematic Universe, this film is going to be a career highlight for most of them. Chadwick Boseman has literally incorporated the phrase 'actions speak more than words' into his acting. He nails the African accent so much that it feels weird when the other characters speak in an American/British accent. Michael B Jordan as Erik Killmonger is a supercool villain this movie needed. While the movie fails to provide much substance to the characters of popular actors Angela Basset, Forrest Whitaker, Andy Serkis and Lupita Nyong'o, it surely has a lot to offer for Danai Gurira and Letitia Wright. They play the characters Okoye and Shuri respectively, who are almost like side kicks to Black Panther. Marting Freeman as agent Everett K. Ross has a slightly funny role. Black Panther is not as entertaining as the other MCU movies, but it surely has its own charm. A new wave is coming to the Hollywood and Black Panther might have laid a very strong foundation to it.</review-text>

		<review-text>The CGI, set, and special effects were incredible, and the acting was organic. It's just that there was nothing outstanding or memorable. Some people were actually checking their watches to see when the movie would be over, and if you think about it, Black Panther is kinda typical--a rich superhero with a cool black suit, like Batman. Nothing super special. I appreciate that we have an almost complete black cast for once, but that didn't do much.</review-text>

		<review-text>The so called &quot;objective&quot; reviews of this film are probably just part of the Facebook campaign that was reportedly going to &quot;ruin&quot; the reviews by posting negative ones before the movie started. Though Facebook took that group down, the completely fabricated and racially tinged dislike of this movie by many of the 3 and below star reviews makes it obvious the plan was still a go. I love the Marvel universe films, and this one did not disappoint. The CGI and effects were just as good as any other film, the fight and action scenes were just as well choreographed. If anything the hand to hand combat scenes were more impressive than I've seen in a Marvel movie in a long time. Most of the time people are wearing their uniforms etc..., not shirtless on a waterfall. The story line was one of the most complicated and multilayered in Marvel history. And for those who don't believe a superhero movie should have any politics in it: Are you Serious? What IS a superhero movie without some political agenda. You are literally going to the movies to watch superhumans who are supposed to save the world! Where was this dislike of political agenda with the Hydra/Nazi storyline that has been on going for Captain America and the like? Was that not politics? The fight to stop the resurgence of a radical enemy who tried to take over the world and is still operating today? Come on Son! The biggest problem many will have when they see this film is perspective. If you are someone who can't relate to characters that don't look and sound like you- then don't see this movie. If you have a larger less myopic world view, you'll enjoy this. By the way, my theater was ethnically mixed, and we laughed all the way thru the film. If you are only going to &quot;hate watch it&quot; then don't go. Save your money. As for the political agenda- the only one I see is situating an Brown Skinned Superhero at the center of a superhero story. One who comes from privilege and not poverty. Offering little children of color to see themselves reflected on screen in a positive and empowering light. Giving them the idea there is a place for them in the super hero catalog. If that is a radical political message you don't support- that says way more about you than the film. And what it says isn't good.</review-text>

		<review-text>If you are a fan of superhero movies, then you will get exactly what you come for when you pay to watch this movie. Everything in this movie just feels like it came straight from a checklist, but if you are okay with that, then this movie is fine. When I left the theater, I felt apathetic. I wasn't disappointed but I certainly wasn't surprised. As I said, you get what you come for. If you care about specifics, keep reading, if not, just know that it is like every other Marvel movie.Plot: If you saw a trailer or even read the IMDB plot synopsis, you have spoiled the movie for yourself. 5 minutes into the movie you can guess where the plot will go, beat by beat. There are no twists, no turns, just your formulaic safe &quot;go here, beat some guys up, talk, go there, beat some guys up, talk, etc.&quot; If you are fine with a predictable plot (will the main character die 15 minutes into the movie?! What?! He doesn't!) then this is the movie for you.Effects: While the art design for this movie is frankly beautiful, the effects are far from. The whole movie feels like it was shot on green screen and some effects are cringe worthy. I am talking about PS2 cutscene levels of bad. Nothing feels real and there is no tension in anything. Characters, pacing, cinematography, basically everything else:The characters are 2 dimensional (the stoic main character, funny smart girl, stoic bodygaurd, wack villain, serious villain who is the antithesis of the main protagonist). The style is &quot;marvel movie&quot;. Take it or leave it. Politics?:There seems to be a misconception that this movie in any way deals with politics. While that is technically true, the issues are handled wit the grace of &quot;should we kill all white people?&quot; &quot;probably not&quot;. There are so many political issues addressed by this movie, isolationism, racism, traditions, etc. but all of them are presented in the fashion of &quot;(insert topic here) is (good/bad)&quot;. It makes no statement that a 10 year old couldn't also make. In all it is far from a bad movie, just incredibly bland.</review-text>

		<review-text>Maybe the worst film I've ever seen. I'm not going to waste much time unpacking the juvenile plot except to say that much of the dialog dripped with sarcasm and contempt for the &quot;white race&quot; who were referred to as &quot;colonizers&quot; and &quot;oppressors&quot; which had stole Africa's rich historical culture and art while profiting from it. Even the villian, who wanted to use his country's superior technology to destroy evil western civilization, was really just a young misunderstood &quot;freedom fighter&quot; trying to set things right. As others have mentioned, I go to the movies for escape from modern American politics, only to find I have paid to be preached to and insulted for 90 minutes. 
 I suppose the second problem and probably the greater problem is the film was boring. The young man why portrayed Black Panther is a good actor and I have admired his work in other films on Netflix so this is nothing against him but there was so many problems with this thing, not even his genius could save it.</review-text>

		<review-text>Many reviews here are stating this and that about Black panther and digging deep, while on the surface Black Panther is as good as any good superhero movie. The cinematography is brilliant, followed by a strong sense of commitment by the actors to their characters, backed up by amazing visual effects and visuals.It is a typical marvel movie,that sets off on a high note and followed by a strong second half. Micheal B Jordan produced yet another charismatic performance as killmonger. Chadwick Bosnan's performance was stiff throughout. Most of his jokes were just cringey and his dialogue delivery was just awful. The plus points to this film include the extra bit of effort put by the costume designers to make everything authentic as hell. Any one would be completely mesmerized by the visuals Black panther has brought on screen, making it one of the best looking Marvel movies to date. Killmonger was yet again a sensible villain. We feel that he has the reason to get his throne and this in turn pushes T'Challa to see into himself and undo the wrong. Black Panther works as a good superhero flick, but marketing it as a movement is just plain absurdity. The film so blatantly imposes that without vibranium, Wakanda and its sprawling civilization would be nothing and would cease to exist. It also has a predictable story and a kind of a forgettable ending. Killmonger deserved more screentime, in comparison to T'Challa. If you're looking for some insane action or some adrenaline rush, Black panther is not for you. It slowly works itself, with some noticeable flaws and mistakes.</review-text>

		<review-text>I read the other reviews and for the first time I am going to say judge for yourself. Go see it. If you are a comic book fan base your opinion on how close the story is to the comics but then judge all the other Marvel Universe movies based on the same standard. 
If you are a movie buff base your review of the cinematography and direction against movies of the same genre.
But if you are like me and just want to go the movie to enjoy a fun time with a powerful message please see it. 
It is a shame that in 2018 everything is viewed through stained cloudy glasses of prejudice. This movie took the high ground and highlighted themes that are common to all people. 
See it as a fan, see it as a movie lover but most importantly see it a human being who can enjoy a story from a different perspective. I loved it,</review-text>

		<review-text>I do not understand the hype about this movie. It is made by competent people who know their craft and know how to elevate an average screenplay to a visual spectacle. Strip away the CGI and what have you got left? Well a standard script that works in Hollywood. Hero becomes king after tragic loss, hero is brave and honest, hero is immensely rich and then it is time for the fall and then of course he gets back on his horse and wins the day and gets the girl. The formula works with a twist here and there but nothing to testing. And it ends like other Hollywood dreams no matter how advanced and technically savvy the world they created is, it always ends up with a fist fight. 
It is not as comedic or refreshing as Deadpool or Guardians Vol1, it is better then Iron Man or most of the other MCU productions. It lacks a spirited hero, this one is bland at best. It has no awesome bad guy with great one liners. it features no memorable characters. Some good actors are here Forest Whitaker, Angela Basset, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis but King Lear it is not. It is a comic book made into a movie and it has no deeper meaning then that. It will kill 2 hours and you won't get bored, a second or even a 3rd watch is a waste time.</review-text>

		<review-text>The good:
Fx were great, Action too, so were the colorful shots and the supporting roles of Angelina Basset and Forest Whitaker.The negligences:
As in most Hollywood movies not much attention is payed to historical correctness, so anyone interested in anthropology will cringe when 
1. they put up someone with a monkey-mask, cherishing the INDIAN god Hanuman, which has nothing to do with AFRICAN culture.
2. Same applies to the botch of accents the actors speak - each one differentI have to give them, however, that the occasional lip plates were correct since the fictional Wakanda does border Ethiopia, where those exist.Errors in thinking:
All wealth and technological advances are attributed to the fictional element called Vibranium, which is not throught through. Since centuries African nations have rare earths which are used to build smartphones etc., but did those precious metals miraculously turn them into the most adanced nations? Obviously not. 
The metals don't automatically create inventions, but human competence and creativity is needed to invent something.
Plus: If any nation would blossom as extreme as Wakanda did, then be sure that greed from any race and nation would expose such wealth very fast and the country would not be left alone for much longer - especially the liberal way they don't protect their information from outsiders they bring in.And finally - the money-making strategy:
Obviously Black Panther as well as Kamala Kahn are well intended first attempts to make balance for the all-white superhero Universe, but they also were great sales pitches to grab a part of a marginalized marked - namely the people who feel racially underrepresented. So this already was a clever move, because it sucks super-hero fans into the theatre as well as a black audience.However - this should not be the focus of the movie, because its major message has less to do with race than with the fact that the USA is - as they were called - the &quot;colonizer&quot; with the intend to destabilise underdeveloped regions in order to dominate them.
Of course such a message can not be shoved into the face of the main marked too heavy, but those words were used and I do respect the movie for having the capacity to reflect on own wrongs.Unfortunately - as one other reviewer said- this message is watered down by also speaking in condescending manners about &quot;another white guy to be rescued&quot; and stuff which is obviously meant to please the black audience.
In the same manners other phrases are thrown into the mix which are designed to please the political right, such as &quot;refugees when coming will bring their problems with them&quot; - thereby neglecting the previous insight that it was the first-world-foreign-policies which in the first place damaged entire continents so much that people have to flee for many decades to come. All in all it was a typical mainstream Hollywood movie which counted on filling a marketing gap whilst at the same time watering down their own message so much that fans of mere entertainment will leave the theatre pleased to know that they don't have to contemplate or formulate an opinion on any political underlying message.All in all it was a missed opportunity to wake us up from our perverted lifestyle and politics which definitely are designed for the benefit of greed to destroy the earth.
Avatar - even though being an equally action based movie - did a much better job in making us reflect and contemplate about the wrongs in this world (including our very own lifestyle).</review-text>

		<review-text>I want to start this review saying that I think it's really silly that this movie has caused a political discussion. Not because the movie and marketing didn't ask for it, but after watching the film, the movie is really nothing more than another marvel film. The movie does things better and worse compared to other marvel films, but as it stands outside of the spectrum, it's predictable and isn't anything more than a superhero film. I'm very glad we have a superhero film that is this heavy in the representation of the black community during this age of popularity in superhero films, but that's really as far as any &quot;political stance&quot; should go into this film.As a movie, it's fine. There wasn't any moment in the film where I felt impressed from what I was looking at, and there were times where I know Marvel can do better. Lets start with what I think it did superior to other marvel films.1. The music. I think this is hands down the best original soundtrack we have gotten from a marvel film, and this is easily on par with the actual usage of their soundtrack outside of the guardian movies. Instead of being generic samey orchestra music that is used in every marvel film, we now have a soundtrack that sticks out from others in the franchise. 2. The villains. Marvel has been getting better with their villains since Guardians Vol 2. And this movie has two. Both of which were my favorite performances in the film, being Michael B Jordan and Andy Serkis respectfully. It's really refreshing also seeing a villain you can root for this time around.3. The designs of the characters, world and weapons. How the CGI looked is a topic for later, but i loved the world of Wakanda and watching the characters walk around it. And every character had something in their design that felt right for the character they were playing.And that's really about it. And those things listed above aren't anything real impressive, just good. Now for the negatives. The CGI and all the effects were horrid. And I can't believe some people are trying to say it was passable. Every time the camera was zoomed out and black panther was on screen he looked straight out of a video game. It was superman in Justice League levels of bad. This goes for most of the environments, spaceships, animals etc. I know CGI is necessary for this movie and I'm not bashing CGI, but when you film outside couldn't you just use the outside? what's the point of the green screen and why does it look so bad? Anytime they were in a room that didn't have anything more than 1 level, it was clearly CGI city. Also the jokes. Marvel movies are known for being pretty funny and generally I agree even when the jokes ruin perfectly good scenes, (cough cough Ragnarok, cough cough Guardians 2) the jokes in this movie gave me a smile at most. And I think a dreamworks executive might of mixed his script into this one because there is a &quot;what are those&quot; joke, a &quot;I make it rain&quot; joke, and a &quot;whip her hair back and forth&quot; joke. Way to slap a stamp on this movie that says &quot;this was made in the 2010's&quot;While the negatives of this film affect my overall score pretty greatly as they are significant parts in the film, the rest of the film is very okay. The story and plot is okay. The dialogue outside of the jokes is okay. The action is okay. If it wasn't for the original setting and feel of the theme in the music this movie would be right alongside Doctor Strange and Ant Man as just another stepping stone for the marvel franchise. I'm glad I watched it, I still enjoyed it, I'm just really not rushing at all to see it again.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is really just another predictable and average Marvel movie. Most Marvel movies I find enjoyable to a certain extent, and would usually rate a 6 or 7/10, but this movie falls short. The characters are weak, the writing and story are quite bland, the acting is whatever, and Black Panther himself is meh. The entire movie is really just a whole bunch of average and boring series of events that follow the cookie cutter format of any other superhero movie. What makes this movie slightly worse than your average superhero movie, is that the humor is terrible and it takes itself far too seriously. We are even treated to a &quot;What are those?!&quot; joke near the middle of the film. Overall, Black Panther is a slighlty below average film that you really don't have to watch. P.S. There is no meaningful political commentary in this film. Don't listen to the people that say there is.</review-text>

		<review-text>The movie itself was pretty good, if not politically charged, but what can you expect these days. I think the character development fell short and disliked the intro/explanation thing that went on near the start of the movie. There was plenty of action and great female supporting cast, the FBI agent guy not so much. The big drag was the villain, the character was poorly developed, shallow, he almost didn't even fit in the movie it was so bad. He did have some cool tribal markings though.</review-text>

		<review-text>Most of the MARVEL movies are able to tell the story and not let the story telling bog the movie down. This one seemed to suffer a bit from that. I had to check my watch a few times. It did not help that the plot was very predictable. When your on a long straight road and you can see 5 miles ahead of you...
The effect were great, acting was good (I really like Boseman / Makes a Great King -Panther ). There is some comedy sprinkled in here and there which helped break a bit of the monotony. The climatic ending did not seem that climatic to me. (Kept thinking so what, their is a whole group of AVENGERS out there if Black Panther fails, big deal)
I watch the other Marvel flicks over again and again, not sure I will be watching this one again</review-text>

		<review-text>Where as I was so excited about the Black Panther, I was disappointed, I wanted to ask for my money back Predictable, bad acting, and thin story.. All while the music director only knew how to play African drum beats from a PBS special. As with all Marvel Films, the effect were good. But...there was nothing original, nothing made this superhero anything different then what we've already seen. What gives, it had a huge budget, and could have been a great piece, but it falls short on many levels. If the cast were not colored, this would have been panned by the critics and word of mouth would let it die a quiet death. I appreciate the attempt, and still feel Black Panther is still a great character but this film just made him a &quot;B&quot; film lead character, or a good supporting character at best. The Black Panther deserves better! Also, why take some of the most attractive woman in the word and shave their heads, does that pass as good acting now? AND... How did one of the Wayans children land the bad guy lead in the film, bad hair and all!I also have a hard time hearing about all this diversity, only to have either a while cast, or a black Cast.... Kind of wish it were more of a chocolate-vanilla swirl ice cream cone... Both are good, but together, they are great.Wish I had waited and rented this film Redbox. it would have been worth it then.</review-text>

They've really outdone themselves with this one.From a critical point of view, the storyline was fantastic and well developed. Marvel departs from their usual one-size-fits-all plot formula, making it difficult to anticipate every next move. Character development was so great that viewers can easily feel emotional attachments to the characters in times of happiness, sadness, pain, and fear. The colors and cinematography were just delicious. Even the costumes were downright amazing. Everything was just so rich! Marvel, THIS is how you need to make movies from now on.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is the 18th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the last before the MCU's biggest film yet, Avengers: Infinity War. Black Panther was always going to be a comic book film that held significance. Like Wonder Woman last year, Black Panther has a cultural significance to it that is going to have a positive effect for the communities it is representing.Like all MCU films in recent years, Black Panther has it's own unique feel. This film has the perfect blend of the space and futuristic setting that Guardians presents with the ancientness and mystical shown in Doctor Strange. Ryan Coogler's directing really leans into that with many shots and scenes embracing the style and reaping the benefits.Also adding to the overall unique feel of the film is the use of music and score. I have always been a big fan of Ludwig Goransson's work with Childish Gambino and I though he did an amazing job with the music. The way it blended African instruments into the score and background music helped set the tone that this film presents. Much credit can also be given to Kenrick Lamar and the decision to bring him on in the first place for the soundtrack. Throughout the film you can hear his touches all throughout and it was a perfect foil to the tradition African instruments.While I have given much credit to the technical aspects of the film, it does not discount the work done by Ryan Coogler and his cast. As mentioned before, Coogler set a tone with this film that feels really unique and did a terrific job in pulling as these pieces together. The work done by Coogler puts him up there along side the work done by Taika Watiti last year as some of the best directing done by a director in the MCU.Getting into the cast, every one amazing in what they had to do. This film had quite a large cast and majority of them got a least one big moment that they got to step up and take a lead role in a scene. To highlight a few performances, Chadwick Boseman took what he did in Civil War and pushed it to a new limit, Michael B. Jordan nailed the role and cemented himself as one of the best villains in the MCU and Lupita Nyong'o brought life into a new character that I am looking forward to seeing in the years to come. Mentioning these roles of course takes nothing away from all the other great performances such as Letita Wright, Andy Serkis, Martin Freeman, Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya and Danai Gurira.Like all MCU films, Black Panther is packed full of action. Again like most MCU films, the action style from Black Panther is a lot different to what we have previously see. The closest comparison for the style of action is something like from the TV show Vikings. We get to see some great tribe battles while getting some really well executed one on one battles. What most of the MCU films get right is the overall writing of the film, and Black Panther is no different. The story was extremely well written and fleshed out. The overall dialog with the characters was great with some terrific beats of humour. From a writing standpoint, there isn't anything in this film that could be seen as at least solid writing.Black Panther is a film that I believe doesn't have any glaring negatives. While each person will come out with little things here and there they didn't enjoy about the film, it is hard to pin point anything that felt out of place or poorly executed. For me, the only slight negative I had is that I feel that the film did not overall cover that much story. While I never felt like the pacing was off or that anything was rushed through, when I looked back at the film and recap it in my head, the list of everything that happened felt quite short. I would have been perfectly happy if they extended the film by 10 minutes or so and added an extra sequence, however the film works perfectly fine without it.Overall, I loved this film. While I am not the community that this film is going to effect significantly, I could still feel the significance of it like I did with Wonder Woman. On top of that, this film is a technical masterclass that all by helps the terrific performances and work done by Ryan Coogler and everyone else involved.9/10</review-text>

		<review-text>After getting to see it this morning It didn't feel too unique from all the other Super Hero movies but at the same time it wasn't bad, I'd day it was entertaining and with its fight scenes and story telling but it did feel lackluster at the same time. Would recommend someone to watch it.</review-text>

	<review id="437">
		<review-text>I'm at a loss for words that I can't even phrase them out carefully.While the story may somewhat fall short, it makes up for it with an interesting cast performance done by Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, and Letitia Wright, the visual setting also feels so immersive you'd think you're actually there. Notably, Freeman's character Everett Ross began to slowly remind me of Clark Gregg's Agent Phil Coulson, but toned down in a different approach for humor. Not to mention the blend of traditional tribal music and an appealing soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar compliments both dramatic and intense scenes respectively.Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, T'challa (Boseman) is chosen to succeed his late father by naming himself as King of Wakanda. Things drastically change when old wounds open from his father's past.After seeing Marvel's previous outing Thor: Ragnarok months back (which relied so much on a comedic approach), Black Panther is definitely a solo film that can hold its own with less humor and its blend of intricate action and drama. I mean based on the flashbacks and despite the intentions T'challa and Killmonger (Jordan) each had for the good of Wakanda, I couldn't help but pity their own respective causes. The former has his ideals and is about being virtuous by working hand-in-hand with their outside allies. Whereas the latter's intentions are morally unjust due to his own troubled past, it's understandable in what he wants but for the wrong reasons.I will say that it's not entirely perfect, but it was more than enough to keep me enthralled at what Black Panther can do.</review-text>

		<review-text>A lot of the low reviews on here miss the mark on what the film was about. It wasn't just a superhero vs the bad guy. It was about a difficult family secret, that changed the dynamics of the storyline. It touched on difficult subjects, and brought to light things that were usually kept in the dark. You will see amazing visual effects, and stunning outfits, including phenomenal performances by the actors and actresses of the film.

		<review-text>Black Panther kicks off really promisingly with an animated/CGI prologue that establishes the history of Wakanda and why they're as secretive as they are, before jumping to 1992 in California and a conflict between King T'Chaka and his younger brother who's been placed as a spy in Oakland. This second prologue sets the stage for the ultimate T'Challa/Killmonger conflict that plays out later in the movie, but I'll admit it takes a while to get there. Instead Black Panther decides to build slowly, spending it's time on developing characters and world-building to establish the cultures and technologies of Wakanda, a previously unseen fictional country of the MCU.But honestly, I didn't mind the slower pace, because the world-building is so good. Wakanda is a nation built from five tribes, and each of them are drastically different from one another, with their own technologies, their own role in Wakandan society, and their own fashions and associated colours. T'Challa's tribe is the royal blood, the keepers of the Vibranium and the spiritual realm, including the spirit of the Black Panther that gives him his powers. There's a border tribe that lives on the outskirts of the country and keeps outsiders out. They appear more impoverished than the rest of the country, but of course it's only a front to save face. They live in huts, breed battle rhinos (you read that right), and have technology that revolves around shielding and defence. There's also the river tribe adorned in shells and turquoise colours, the sun tribe emblazoned in gold, and the outcast mountain tribe who cause a minor nuisance every chance they get.Honestly Black Panther's biggest strength is it's costuming/makeup and production design. There is no other movie that looks like Black Panther. It's aesthetic that marries traditional African designs and colours with wealthy/futuristic tech and architecture is unique. One of the River Tribe is a dapper-looking guy in a turquoise suit with traditional African lip plate, which is an equally bizarre and awesome aesthetic. General clothing is emblazoned in African patterns and colours with a modern stylising, and many characters show off tribal tattooing like facial scarification. Many walk around barefoot despite the obvious advancements in technology to be able to craft shoes and sandals (both of which T'Challa wears himself). The cityscape is full of futuristic skyscrapers topped off with African huts and buildings.But the traditional African aesthetic just stop there, it also leaks into the music, combining effortlessly with both modern Hip-Hop and your typical flavour of orchestral film score, sometimes all at the same time. I'm listening to the Kendrick Lamar-curated accompaniment album now and I'll admit I'm not digging it (although Pray For Me with The Weekend is pretty good), but the film's score is a different entity entirely. It makes a lot of use of African percussion, with the talking drum being instrumental in the film's audible identity, being used as both a main theme for the film, as well as providing some really good tension. As well as this there's often a typical hip-hop beat that comes in and out and instantly makes any and every scene it's used in feel inherently cooler and more badass. The orchestral element is, in typical Marvel fashion, still a little by-the-numbers at best, and just plain misused at worst. Even so Ludwig Goransson has crafted probably the most unique score Marvel have ever enjoyed (better even than Ragnarok, and Guardians doesn't count because that was all licensed).But I feel I've been focussing too much on the stylistic merits of Black Panther. They're undoubtedly the film's strongest suites, but that doesn't mean the rest of the film falls to the wayside. The story takes a while to pick up, it's true, but once it does it becomes full of political intrigue, and drives home it's message of worldwide responsibility. Killmonger is a fairly typical African-American who feels entitled by virtue of his skin colour, while ultimately not really understanding what his heritage means. He wants to use Wakandan tech to destabilise the world's governments and put Africans on the top of the world ladder for once. Meanwhile both Nakia and Shuri see the potential in Wakanda reaching out and providing aid to the countries that need it. While both viewpoints are stark opposites, they both revolve around Wakanda ditching its secretive nature and taking a more diplomatic standpoint on the world stage.Killmonger as a villain isn't too bad. While I wouldn't say he's a great villain in his own right, when compared to the rest of the Marvel villain roster, he's certainly one of the more developed ones. Wronged at a young age, he seeks to return to what he sees as his birthright. He has motivations and an intertwined history with T'Challa and the Wakandan royal family. I mean, compared to the likes of Malekith or Kaecilius, Killmonger is a breath of fresh air. Similar could be said of Andy Serkis' return as Ulysses Klaue, who is also not a particularly engaging villain in his own right, but Serkis just chews up the scenery (not only that, but beefed up with a tightly grown beard, and a waistcoat barely big enough to contain him, he's looks pretty badass).Chadwick Boseman gets almost the entire movie to flex his muscles as T'Challa, and manages really well to keep him the wise-beyond-his-years king. I'm not entirely convinced he can hold a whole movie himself though, as Black Panther was definitely kept afloat more by its supporting cast than by its lead. Luipta Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman, Winston Duke, and even Sterling K. Brown's small appearance all join together to give the movie an acting backbone to be proud of.Is Black Panther one of the best Marvel movies to date? I don't think so. It doesn't always hit the mark, and it's action sequences just become a blur of boring choreography, and its story is an interesting one, but feels a little diluted and probably too on-the-nose. From a stylistic viewpoint though, Black Panther not only stands out from the crowd of Marvel movies, but from blockbusters in general. I can't wait to see more of Wakanda in a few months come Infinity War. I give Black Panther a solid 8/10.</review-text>

		<review-text>It seems that critics just love to throw big numbers to every superhero films last year. Logan, just a sad film with a way more interesting characters. everybody's getting old and dying. overall, a slighly above average superhero film. Wonder Woman, same case. interesting background story, but i was wishing more, more complexity that could have been showcased because the character was interesting enough. Thor: Ragnarok, i felt like i was watching different film. the whole film seems like a parody of the previous installments, which means a parody of bad films. And now, Black Panther. I'm not saying that this film is far from cheese and cheap thrill, and i'm not saying that the plot has improved from any other hollywood or superhero films. The film is a perfect marriage between great concept and great value.the background story of the film is more interesting than most of MCU films or story. one of the villain said that Wakanda is the real El Dorado. it is, but the place were kept by people with higher moral value and great understanding of virtue. They were not only deserve to keep the treasure and knowledge from the land, but also protect it from bad people. they were not drowned in it but maintaining it. their leader is the main character, the Black Panther.the film has two villain. the first one is a colonial type that seek power and fortune for himself. and the second one is more complex than the first one. he's a very angry person, and for reasons, has the right to be. his actions was very logic and has a great purpose. but what is a great purpose if you have a better one. that's the Wakanda people's code of ethic. peace. the value of philosopher. no wonder that they got to rule that El Dorado.there are several MCU films that i liked, the others i disliked, and Three that i loved. they are:
Iron Man. great plot and a superb characterCaptain America: Civil War, Epic sequences and a great story, also a beautiful tragedyBlack Panther: great concept and great moral valueand i'm hoping there will be others to follow</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is such a fun time for Marvel fans. Even for fans who don't watch Marvel's movies consistently, this movie delivers. There are some events that conclude in this movie that took place in Captain America: Civil War (2016), but the film summarizes everything so no audience member is confused. Michael B Jordan is phenomenal as Erik Kilmonger, he is (in my opinion), one of the best Marvel villains in a while. The girls around him (Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and Letitia Wright), all do an amazing job not only to elevate T'Challa, but themselves as well. The movie just delivers in all cylinders, great film.</review-text>

		<review-text>I didn't know what to expect walking into the cinema - I'm always wary not to fall for the hype - but I left literally shaking. My wife's son and I bought tickets together and sat in the back row near the exits like he always done, and watched an amazing film unfold. Chadwick Boseman was amazing, but I kind of liked Michael B Jordan as Killmonger too. The idea of Wakanda as a black ethno-state was a bit confronting initially for me as a black man - there's been too much of this in the news recently - but it was wonderful to see Afrika portrayed as it should be. An advanced continent with a rich history and diverse cultures, without the yoke of imperialism or colonisation. 9/10 recommend, but only because the popcorn was cold.p.s. daily reminder WE WERE KINGS!!</review-text>

		<review-text>Not only is the film visually stunning, but the movie has a great story that keeps viewers interested. Black Panther has a uniquely imaginative setting based on the real strength, riches, and beauty of African civilizations, and introduces it to real events in history, and issues faced by the generation of black youth and others dubbed as minorities even in this modern day. The movie is also loaded with lots of fun action. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the amazing choreography, especially among the gorgeous warrior women. The movie has a rich cast, filled with gifted actors both familiar and new. Anyone would enjoy this movie, but in particular, any black person, of any age could easilly find inspiration and role models in this movie, not only because it has a black hero with a cool suit and neat technology, but also because of his struggles and responsibilities before and after becoming an African King, which I thought were well projected throughout the movie. There wasn't one character in the film who didn't have a strong significance in one way or another, and The Black Panther respected them all, even those who would seek to destroy him... All in all, this is a must see film!</review-text>

		<review-text>Well, I loved it and fully believe it walks with Marvel's best (which I feel are Captain America 2; Iron Man; Avengers; Thor Ragnarok; Guardians 2 and Doctor Strange).Not because of the incredible visuals - wow. just extraordinary and rich and very, very well thought through as they were.But because of the way the story meshes with the Characters/ performances (one needs the other and here you get both). It wasn't a wholly unique plot: Boy loses country, boy finds country/ a journey of self discovery in which the hero uncovers not all is what he thought it was.But... the story was given a hero with conscience and a villain who didn't just want to take over the world because he wanted a gold toilet. My only concerns here were that I feel Whittaker was under- used/developed and Kaluuya's character arc unresolved (although perhaps that is a future focus). Boseman was magnificent. At turns both tortured and elated. Nyongo; Bassett and Freeman were all on their A Game. Standouts for me personally though were Guirai; Jordan; Serkis and Wright. Both they and their characters worked excellently. In particular, I could watch these guys all day. I believe Wright could carry her own Black Panther sequel one day. Serkis was his powerhouse best and Jordan... well... his characterisation lifted it again for me. I could feel his anger and his 'cause'. The Director wisely left us to our own reflections on whether one of the two 'masked' the other or if they 'walked in parallel'. The 'cause' part was interesting as there was a real philosophical weight to that as in the best of Marvel. The Winter Soldier asks if we have the balance right between freedom and protection and the Panther asks if are right to isolate ourselves - should we act or wait? Wakanda's isolationism may be illusory: is non-intervention really just a sin of omission? Heavy stuff, but Coogler proves up to the lifting for me.Black Panther was everything I hoped it would be and I want to return to Wakanda now every bit as much as to the stories of my favourites, Captain America and Doctor Strange.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther will frighten many people. The depth and acknowledgement of native African and African-American social and cultural history will be viewed by some with fear and skepticism. As a 'conscious' middle-aged African-American male, the theme, the scope and the subject matter (father/son relationships, disconnected from lineage, home(land) and history, etc.) will immediately resonate with those of us in the 'community' who can relate to these issues. For many, these images, in this film, may seem wasteful and monotonous. But for those of us in the African-American community (especially here in the U.S.), these representations are displays of our totality as humane human beings whose emotional turmoil is finally being addressed. Having such a majestic, intellectually and visually stunning big-budget, big-screen major Hollywood movie production with an overwhelmingly dominant African-American cast - who exist in positions of power, control and authority, and not in servile or secondary roles - has the potential to skewer the perception of the uninitiated or the uninformed because Black Panther is a type of production that has never-before been seen in this way and on this scale. While there may be some who miss nuanced references common within the African-American diaspora (expressions, relationships, tone, presence) that are reflective in our interactions with each other - outside of mainstream engagement, the political pronouncements will probably engender the most backlash and confusion. From the Dora Milaje, to the descriptions of black and brown people as kings, queens, scientists, thinkers, world leaders and leaders of men and women, such representations of regal strength and character present a stark departure from that which is ubiquitous in the landscape of film, television, print, radio and mass/social media proliferation.</review-text>

		<review-text>A rugged movie - with bold choice of role crew. Something that's actually needed, in today's worldview. The movie is great. Although something could be done better. But the best thing about the whole movie is actually all the amazing female actors: Lupita Nyong'o, Angela Bassett, Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira, Florence Kasumba, Nabiyah Be, Connie Chiume, Zola Williams etc.. We can really talk about black girl power, beauty and power hand in hand. That some things could have been done elsewhere does not really matter. But it will be a little bit of it when it comes to my overall assessment.</review-text>

		<review-text>IMDB has been my source of information about movies eversince, and I usually go through the reviews first before I watch a movie. Before seeing BP, 
I was a lil worried because there has just been so many poor ratings given to this movie but on the other hand I was thinking maybe people just really hate to see black people excel and shine as a superhero.I watched it this afternoon here in the Philippines and i could say that there are just too many haters here on IMDB trying to put down this one emotional thriller! I'm no expert in movies but BP has a great message that it wants to convey not just politically or racially but also depicting what it truly means to be a leader whom people look up to and taking a stand to what the past mistakes of other people will cost your leadership in the present. This movie will also serve as an inspiration to black people who for the longest time has been depicted as thugs, gangsters an the like. BP is someone black kids will look up to and will open their eyes and give them hopes that they too belong in this world and can be a hero of their own.This is my first ever review and I'm no expert critic and I don't know how to review a movie based on its technical aspects but I could personally say that this one is an enjoyable movie and deserves to be recommended. Ignore the bad reviews! watch this truly EMOTIONAL THRILLER!</review-text>

		<review-text>The visuals were gorgeous through and through the plot gave us a strong sense of what the comics always aimed for and stayed very true to each character. The fight seems we're exciting to watch there wasn't just chock-full of special affects my actual martial arts and well-crafted choreographed fighting between multiple members of the cast and last but not least this Cast has been a saving grace to the superhero world no one was helpless or needy everyone had strong beautifully crafted back stories that they were all able to bring to the forefront be it on large scales or in intricate details. This movie truly has been the superhero movie that we desperately so need at a time like this. WAKANDA FOREVER.</review-text>

		<review-title>The Best</review-title>
	</review>
	<review id="453">
		<review-text>The truth is this movie is fantastic. It is a film that celebrates some of the most sacred building blocks of community and prosperity. Coogler, who is still fresh off the success of his two brilliant previous films (Fruitvale Station, Creed), returns with his most ambitious and rewarding film yet and I can personally guarantee that despite the obvious success he has ahead of him, this movie will forever be a jewel in Coogler's crown. Black Panther does so much to elevate not just what a superhero movie can be, but what it has the potential to say. Indeed, Black Panther's defining moments are not the action sequences (although they are breathtaking to say the least), but are truly the character moments, especially those that contribute to Black Panther's overall narrative which is to keep moving towards a brighter future, despite the darkness that may lie in the sins of the past. Chadwick Boseman dominates as both T'Challa and Black Panther. He manages to both say so much with an expression, and yet also beautifully put to words the complex struggles he faces over the course of the movie. And in complete honesty, Boseman does carry this movie on his shoulders. Luckily he has a phenomenal circle of deeply engaging and complex characters within his inner circle to lighten that weight. Letitia Wright as Shuri is a particular stand out as her wit and humour is guaranteed to make anyone with a beating heart smile. Danai Gurira is incredible as the ruthless Okoye, and Lupita Nyong'o manages to accomplish such a gorgeous balance of guiding hand and warrior. But, when it comes down to it, this movie would not be what it is without Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger. This is by far the best villain the MCU has ever had (yes even better than Loki). Jordan manages to be both merciless and cold hearted, all while emanating the rage and torture of being a man with nothing to lose, because everything he had has already been taken from him. You will both despise and want more of Killmonger and that is where a good villain should be. Finally, we must discuss the utter magnificence that is Wakanda. Black Panther displays its enthralling African kingdom with so much marvellous detail that it makes you wish it were a real place so you could hop on the next plane there. But beyond it's allure and beauty, Wakanda is a place of culture and tradition. While the movie easily could have skipped past the Wakandan world building, it is clear that those behind the camera were determined to give viewers a taste of a unique culture that also draws on so many ancient African elements, all while effortlessly blending it with colour, technology, and other more futuristic elements. One of my favourite things about this movie is that while it is clearly an MCU movie, it has nothing to do with the MCU besides the involvement of Klaue and the metal Vibranium. So, at no point in this film will you feel as if the movie is trying to build towards some other payoff in a different movie. This is Black Panther's movie and it is solely about his journey and what him and his people are going through. This makes the movie that much more captivating because it immediately allows the viewer to understand that they are watching a great film in general and not just a great MCU film. 
All in all I have to give Black Panther a 10/10 for being more than just a movie, but also a message and a movement.</review-text>

		<review-text>**SPOILERS**
Black Panther so far is one of the best MCU movies that I've seen to date. The musical score was on point and fit every scene, the set, the colors (One of the reasons why I enjoy GOTG and Thor Ragnorok) I wasn't expecting much humor in BP but I was pleasantly surprised by the small pockets and to me the small jokes and comments fit perfectly. I'm a big fan of a serious storyline mixed with a bit of humor and Ryan did just the right amount. For a movie spanning 2 hours, RG was able give us fascinating characters with well-written arcs out of huge cast and that's not an easy thing to do. 
We learn about T'Challa's rise as a king, wanting to follow his father's footsteps only to find out that his father made huge mistakes and those mistakes have consequences and T'Challa has to change his entire mindset of what it means to be a king.
Nakia's relationship with her homeland and the outside world. Ross had a totally different mindset of what he thought he knew. Eric Kilmonger is simply one of the best developed villains of the MCU. He made you care about him, even though he went about things the evil way. He killed his girl, just like that. But you understood why he was the way he was. 
Okoye with her principles and strict tradition but her eyes were opened that you cannot blindly defend something that is clearly wrong. Unfortunately, her love, W'Kabi was too blinded by the death of his parents to understand that. Even though he disagreed with T'Challa's method, he straight jumped to Kilmonger's side and I thought it was powerful moment when Okoye confronted him on the battlefield. 
Claw was a surprise, I didn't expect that, but he had his purpose and he made a big impression when he was on screen. When they walked through the metal detectors, that had me laughing cause he didn't give an F, lol.
Not a big fan of FW but hey, loved his role and he had been holding on to that guilt of King T'Chaka killing his own brother and leaving the son behind, a long time. When he sacrificed himself, it was for the best.
The Dora Milaje were just bad ass.
Shuri is that little sister that bugs the hell out of you but she's so cute, you can't help but love her, also she's smart as hell and I would love to see her go up against Tony Stark and bring his cockiness down a few notches. That would be fun to see.
Overall, it was entertaining, the music was great, the storyline kept my attention the entire time.</review-text>

		<review-text>First of all, let's start off by saying that I loved Black Panther. It was everything I wanted it to be and more.The Pros are endless. The acting alone is worth notifying. Daniel Kaluuya, Andy Serkis, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman, Forest Whitaker and Michael B. Jordan all do fantastic.But it all really does come down to the performance of Chadwick Boseman as the Black Panther himself, doesn't it? I'l tell you what, he is stellar. His performance as T'challa is so subtle and so on point with the comics, which I'm a huge fan of.Next up, the action scenes/directing. I could not be happier for Ryan Coogler right now, with this, Creed, and Fruitvale Station. I do have to say I was a bit dissapointed with the final fight, but that's mostly on the lighting team.The story is great, the cast is great, the overall movie as a whole is great. I have but one flaw with it and this flaw could be considered a nitpick by many.My flaw is that it does become the stereotypical marvel movie once in a while. There are certain character actions that wouldn't make sense in the actual tone that the movie presents us with, times where a character makes an unnecessary pun, and even an SUV chase towards the middle of the film.I overall loved Black Panther. It has a very essential meaning to it that I personally think everyone will grasp hold of and also fun sequences that everyone will enjoy.Black Panther gets an A or on an Imdb scale, a 9</review-text>

		<review-text>I made an account just to review this movie because I think it is worth the hype. If you haven't seen the numerous other Marvel movies, fear not. Black Panther stands on its own, and doesn't feel like an episode in a series like many of the other Marvel films. Most of the film takes place in Wakanda, an African dreamland that is both traditional and futuristic. When the film jumps to other locations around the world like London and South Korea (got to target that Asian market) I found myself wishing they would go back to Wakanda just because it is so visually stunning. The plot is solid and the actors are excellent. So much in fact, I wish they had spent more time on character development. The film seems to focus more on the villian, Killmonger, than the hero, T'Challa. I'm not complaining though, because Killmonger is an interesting character, and Michael B. Jordan is captivating. Black Panther brings up some heavy themes, and I think they could have gone further with them. Maybe in the sequels (I hope there will be sequels!) they will. The set design, costumes, and especially the music of Black Panther make it a joy to watch. I highly recommend it.</review-text>

		<review-text>I went to see this movie with my friend in theaters without either of us knowing anything about the character. The biggest thing that took away from my experience of this movie was some a**hole who thought it would be a good idea to go on their phone during the climax and light up the theater. In case you're reading this review before you watch, I'd like to let you know that there are two end credits scenes. If you like watching them, be sure to wait around until the very end. I have a lot to say about this movie, so I'm going to organize it by category to make it all easier to read and understand. Cinematography - The CGI in this movie was a bit inconsistent. Some scenes looked really fake while the majority was extremely well done. Most of the fight scenes were done very well, while others looked terrible (there was a fight scene at the beginning taking place in the middle of a forest that looked terrible). Overall, this was a very colorful and aesthetically pleasing film. Characters - The acting was amazing all around, bringing these characters to life. Though most of the characters were intelligent, I did find The Black Panther's dad to be one of the most stupid and infuriating people to ever exist on this planet. Most of the characters had some kind of motivation for doing what they were doing, which just made them even more believable. Plot - The plot was predictable. I predicted the majority of the events before they even happen. Though I had a lot of fun watching this movie, the plot was pretty cliche and formulaic. There weren't too many character arcs and a movie that had so much potential fell a bit flat. There could've been more conflict and possibly some kind of internal struggle within the main character to make it more interesting, but for some reason they decided not to do that. The Fight Scenes - Save for a few shots of your standard hyper edited Marvel movie fight scene bs, the majority of the fight scenes in this movie are well-coreographed. Despite there being no tension (because all the &quot;good guys&quot; are basically invisible) they are pretty fun. However, there is a scene where a woman gets her throat slit and there is no blood. There are actually a lot of scenes with people getting stabbed and there being no blood. This is a movie that will drop the f-bomb but avoid blood at almost all costs. You can't just pull a spear out of someone's abdomen and had it be shiny and clean THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS. The Humor - The movie mostly fails at this. There are a few funny elements to this movie (like the leader of the mountain tribe) but most of the &quot;humor&quot; consists of outdated memes. There is actually a scene where a character makes a 4-year-old &quot;what are those reference&quot; and everyone in the theater cringed loudly (there were a lot of people in that theater). However, later in the same scene the same character is involved in a pretty funny gag where she kinda pranks The Black Panther by withholding information on his new suit. Like the CGI, the humor in this movie is inconstant in quality. Technology - Unlike other movies with futuristic technology, all of the tech shown in this movie looked convenient and actually useful in some way. Sound Design - The soundtrack for this movie was amazing (in my opinion) and unique. The sound design also helped with bringing to life this futuristic world. I have some hearing difficulties an usually have a lot of trouble understanding speech (at home I usually watch movies with the subtitles turned on) and especially people with accents different from my own, but at no point was I struggling to understand an English-speaking character in this movie. The music and background noise doesn't drown out the characters speaking. Also most everyone in the theater was polite enough to let everyone hear what was going on. I'm just mentioning all this because it was greatly appreciated. I realize that not everyone is going to enjoy this movie like I did, and there are plenty of people who will get bored by the 2 hour+ runtime, but I was throughly invested for the entire duration of the movie. I believe I've explained my reasons. If you don't like Marvel movies, don't see it. If you think that a sci-fi superhero story with incredible new worlds and a fun story sounds interesting, go see it. If you are someone who thinks that this movie is in any way trying to be political, I'd recommend that you go see a psychologist. There is nothing political about this movie. Its a fun dumb superhero movie with black main characters. I don't see why there are people using this movie in discussions about race.</review-text>

		<review-text>I was one of those that wasn't expecting too much, however, I feel this marvel film had a better storyline and better background support for its characters than any Marvel film in 2017 for sure. It wasn't perfect, however, there was a lot detail put into this film in areas where there was lacking.</review-text>

Everything about the movie is perfect. The cast is amazing, the make-up was brilliant, the costumes were gorgeous, the music was outstanding and the action scenes were so well done.

		<review-text>I admit to not knowing much about the Black Panther, but I have read some comics with him in it. The only things I knew was that his real name was T'Challa and he came from the fictional country of Wakanda, a technologically advanced place with a policy of isolation. That's really all you have to know to enjoy this movie! This movie really downplays the superhero aspect. It's a lot more about this country deciding whether or not it should release its technology to the rest of the world.The end credits assure us that the Black Panther will be in the next Avengers movie. This movie is simply beautiful to look at. Every time we get a good look at Wakanda's world, it's a visual delight. It really downplays the aspect of it being in the Marvel Cinematic Universe . I really thought that was something new and different for these creators. We get great action scenes and enough interesting things to keep any newcomer intrigued. ***1/2</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is back after Civil War! Before, I was assured myself that this movie would be the best superhero movie in 2018 if Infinity War wouldn't released in the same year. Now, the outcome is great.Firstly, I do like the opening scene. It can be said that it's different from other MCU's films. New formula for the next phase, I think. Secondly, please someone give the person whose responsible for the choreography in this movie a lot of cookie. Black Panther isn't a martial art themed superhero but it nailed it. So much better than the choreography in the series of protector of K'un-Lun. Third, the humor. Back in the Ragnarok last year, Marvel served us an action-humor movie. Thus, my expectation is Black Panther will be not so different from Ragnarok. I can't said that this movie will not have any humour. It has precise portion of humour and I totally laughing out loud from its jokes. Last, the cast. Hands down for all the cast. Totally great job, especially you Andy Serkins.Closing statement. Black Panther is a beautiful superhero movie. The plot, the bgm, and of course the scenery. 9 of 10.P.S : There are two post-end credit scenes. Just wait. It's worth your time in the second scenes. Ciao.</review-text>

		<review-text>Ignore the negative reviews... we all know the agenda of the vast majority of them. This is an awesome movie. I hope they do another at least a few more standalones with the Black Panther (versus a huge Avengers movie, where you can't get into the individual characters much at all). I wanted a lot more about this world and these characters! The fight scenes are awesome, the plot is interesting, the female characters rock, there are a lot of complex real-world issues raised.

		<review-text>Black Panther is one of the most incredible things I've ever, ever seen. The women are AMAZING. The score and sound design are incredible - it's the best score I've ever heard in any film. It's visually beautiful beyond description. I didn't feel like I was watching a Marvel film, and I like Marvel films. It has IDEAS, political thought and a worldview in a way that no other Marvel film has attempted, and is meaningful and resonant in a way blockbusters almost never are. It's deeply non-western. The villain's motivation is understandable and relatable, overcoming the MCU villain problem for probably the first time ever. The cast are tremendous. It's an afrofuturist dream and is, throughout, deeply moving. It's transformative not feelgood, deep not glib, unifying and courageous not divisive. It's better than Harry Potter, better than LOTR, better than The Hunger Games, better than the entire MCU. It takes everything tired about the superhero/epic fantasy/&quot;hero's journey&quot; genre and transcends/ reconceptualizes it in a way that's never expected and consistently thrilling and gripping. It's impeccably paced and structured and flows completely naturally (in a world where blockbusters are so often a series of setpieces bridged by interstitial dialogue) - it's logical and coherent with plot and character in perfect harmony, nothing feels contrived, committee-written, focus-grouped or market-tested. I'm in absolute raptures over it. It kicks its entire genre out of the park.This is a film that says you don't have to give up your traditions to be modern and developed. That non-westerners shouldn't be ashamed of their culture and give up their customs, their dress, their music, their dances, everything that gives their culture an identity and that's grown up over hundreds of years, in the rush to westernize. That allows its characters to debate the merits and drawbacks of isolationism versus outreach. This is a revolutionary film that should and will have a huge cultural footprint lasting decades and mean a lot to so many young people. It not only articulates debates between constructive activism and destructive activism, hard and soft power, but has the conviction of its principles to come down on one side of them. It deserves to have a cultural impact as big as the original Star Wars.</review-text>

		<review-text>This was the first time I'd been excited for a Marvel movie in a long while, and it was absolutely worth the wait, and I think it completely lived up to the hype. Artistically, the film was beautiful and original, with moments like the visits to the ancestral plane, and T'Challa and Killmonger's fall through the vibranium mine taking my breath away. The storyline itself was powerful, and was what really makes me praise it so highly. Killmonger is an extremely well-developed villain, with motives that are understandable. It's easy to find compassion for him, because his pain and anger comes from a very very real place, from an issue that is not foreign to us. The fact that Black Panther introduces so many new characters while giving each one of them deep, nuanced characterization is just one sign of how much care and thought went into its writing. I could go on forever about the things I loved about this movie, but to summarize: go see it, and listen to what it has to say.</review-text>

		<review-text>I found the movie to be absolutely fantastic. Chadwick Boseman was wonderful as King T'Challa with a superb supporting cast. Michael B Jordan's character was a far more relate-able villain than other Marvel villain's to the point you feel sorry for him and almost want him to succeed. A villain with good reasons that have fallen to corruption and anger where he becomes the very thing he's trying to fight against. You are both interested in Killmonger as well as disgusted with him. He makes you hate him, but feel sorry for him and kind of want him to succeed.The story is intriguing and the lines of good and bad have become blurred. It grabs your attention and holds you tight as it takes you on a ride through family dynamics and the decision to leave Wakanda hiding, or let the world know Wakanda.I find it hard to explain...So I ask that you see it. You MUST see this movie. Go out. Get a ticket. Watch it. This movie isn't just a good Marvel movie...it's a good movie. It needs our support.</review-text>

		<review-text>Movie has a bit of everything for everyone from the music and the amazing cast, Chadwick Boseman, Michael B Jordan as well as the whole female cast were excellent. Really wanted more Killmonger, the screen time he did have was satisfying enough. They all rose above the need for constant action in a superhero film and actually carried the film well instead of the other way round. It was beautiful and grabbed me from beginning to end. Marvels greatest score so far? I Think so. I had been looking forward to Black Panther ever since I saw the first concept for his costume and it did not disappoint. Glad to hear it could do $200+ Million opening weekend just to show these people hate will not stop this movie from being successful. We will combat your hate with Love and our wallets to show you the world will not be any scarier when Black Panther is a successful movie. Bring on Infinity War and Black Panther 2 +</review-text>

		<review-text>'Black Panther' is another solid Marvel film, but thankfully works as a standalone action film and family drama. T'Challa (Boseman) - first introduced in 'Captain America: Civil War' - becomes King of Wakanda (a fictional African country) and has to deal with the dual responsibilities of following traditions, keeping his family and country safe and being the Black Panther (basically Batman - rich guy who can fight good and has a good suit and gadgets). There's a really great support cast - Killmonger (Jordon) as the long-lost cousin, Nakia (Nyong'o) as the ex-girlfriend/conscience, Okoye (Gurira) as his General, Ross (Freeman) as the CIA agent, Klaue (Serkis) as the mercenary, Zuri (Whitaker) as the shaman, Shuri (Wright) as his sister, Ramonda (Bassett) as his mum and W'Kabi (Kaluuya) as his best friend. However, Boseman really carries the film, with a lot of poise and calmness, but then extreme passion when needed. The plot's not too complicated and has an obvious ending, but the 2 &amp; a quarter hours are well worth it.There's plenty of stunning CGI (probably too much, since none of the film was actually shot in Africa, a big shame - feels like if they filmed in South Korea, they could go to Kenya or Zimbabwe for a few real-life shots), a good tribal-drum score, some great action scenes and plenty of hand-to-hand combat scenes too. However, at it's heart is a good story of responsibility and doing what's right over what's easy or the usual way.</review-text>

		<review-text>I have been a fan of marvel since Iron Man, and in the later Marvel movies, it all had a funny touch, except this one. The serious side is a focus and i like it, because this are super heroes and putting a solid funny punchlines ruin the idea of being a leader or a hero. At the same time, the story was captivating. The build up with black panther was huge. I followed the story, feeling the characters fighting to glory. The hero recognize the mistake of the system and changed it to make it right. Without A list actors, this will still be a hit with full pack story line.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther has been one of the most anticipated movies of 2018, hype building up globally as the world waited for its release. Its near perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes has done nothing but exacerbate this hype, and I can confirm that the hype is definitely justified. Black Panther probably won't start the conversations about race that some critics might have you thinking, but it's just such a tasteful, entertaining, unique movie that does so much more than your typical Marvel flick.The film is set about a week after the events of Civil War, where T'Challa's father was killed at a bombing at a UN Convention in Vienna. T'Challa is still struggling to come to terms with the death of his father and the king of Wakanda, the setting of the entire film. It's this struggle that the movie focuses on at first.The movie unfolds rather neatly, especially for a Marvel film, with the majority of the film centring in Wakanda. (Seems like Marvel's doing a lot more location centralisation; GOTG2 is mainly on Ego's planet, Thor: Ragnarok has a lot on Sakaar...it's better this way). I think some of the key highlights of Black Panther have to be the characters. Chadwick Boseman shines as T'Challa; seriously, his silent bad-assery is stunning. Shuri, T'Challa's sister, is probably my favourite character in the film, she's just really funny and sweet. Nakia and Okoye are both very powerful female characters in the film, both taking their turns in guiding T'Challa in his times of need.It's definitely the villain that many have really loved about this movie. Personally, while I loved Killmonger, I think maybe it would've been cooler if we got to delve a little more into his backstory and really understand his motives. Also, Claw is...just there...but when he is, he's fine. Martin Freeman returns as Agent Ross from Civil War, and while I'll readily admit I didn't need to see him back, it's nice to see him take on a bigger role in this movie as we delve more into his character.I feel like Marvel movies are slowly becoming more and more grounded as Marvel mature, and that definitely shows in Black Panther. The film is easily their most mature film yet; Thor: Ragnarok is plain fun, Spiderman Homecoming is just another packed Spiderman film, but Black Panther feels very deep and important. It explores very important themes, that of race, of T'Challa's moral battles, the theme of leadership and monarchy...Marvel have proved time and again that a superhero movie can be a comedy, and now they've just proven they can also be something so much more meaningful.You see, Black Panther is a very neat film. You can lose yourself in the stunning action of Avengers: Age of Ultron, but Black Panther will keep you engaged in its meaningful story, embroiled in its chief themes. All the characters shine as they deliver the movie's message about the challenges of being a leader, and the consequences of every action, big and small. I don't want to give the plot away, but its themes are what set it apart from any other Marvel film.Now, I can't say it's a perfect movie. I did like Killmonger, but let's be honest; at the end of the day, he's just another Marvel villain. Basically that means he just feels like he's there...never much of a huge threat. (I mean we already KNOW that Black Panther survives already, we saw him in the Infinity War trailer!) It's basically the same feeling for Claw. There's also Killmonger's girlfriend who we never really get to see that much of, which is sorta a shame, I guess I can forgive that though.Also, I think the soundtrack of this movie was a real highlight. I don't like trap music at all but I think it actually blended with this movie reasonably well. The soundtrack also sounded very traditional-African, especially given that Wakanda is a fake-country. That's actually one of the things you have to remember about this movie; it's as though it's trying hard to respect Wakandan culture, even though this culture is completely fictional. But hey, that's fine, right?In the end, there's isn't all that much to fault about Black Panther. I think its themes are its real strong point. Okay, so while it's got powerful themes at the end of the day it's still a superhero movie, so don't expect to be blown out of your socks. But still, it's just got such great, well-rounded characters that you find yourself really believing in, and a very nice, neat story. If you watch any movie before summer ends (it's summer here in Australia), make sure it's Black Panther. Many critics have called it the best movie in the MCU; I might not go quite as far to make that claim, but it's definitely close. Go and watch it, and make the choice for yourselves.</review-text>
		<review-title>The hype is very real for this both typical and different Marvel movie; go watch it!</review-title>

		<review-text>I saw Black Panther during its opening weekend, and I really feel it was worth all the hype. It felt less like a super hero movie and more like a drama with story aplenty. It immerses you from the beginning, plunging you in to life for these characters in Wakanda, and makes you want to root for them from the opening scenes. Chadwick Boseman is excellent as both man about to become king and super hero Black Panther. The supporting cast are incredible and the special effects are awe inspiring. I would have to rate this as my second favorite in the whole Marvel Universe, after the first Guardians of the Galaxy-which tops my list mostly due to the extremely fun to watch cast. Definitely a must see!</review-text>

		<review-text>Black panther is the demonstration that if Marvel wants to deliver frames without so much humor it can do it, undoubtedly one of the best movies of super heroes, by not trying to be a film of origin and not being the prelude to Infinity war that is, he found a perfect balance as an individual film and connected to his cinematographic universe his director Ryan Coogler is noted that he knows how to make great stories and that let him tell it his way is to applaud, the cast is great from Chadwick Boseman as the black panther, Michael B Jordan as a truly intimidating antagonist, Lupita Nyong'o great actress, even the little or much that Andy Serkis plays is appreciated, the score by Ludwig Göransson is impressive since it is rare to see that they dedicate more to the soundtrack than songs that is to admire and applaud (I appreciate that it was not pure rap, not because I do not like it but it is a very common cliche) and the picture of Rachel Morrison is truly spectacular, the only thing I could say that it is the CGI that there are certain sequences that are not as solid as the plot base, in conclusion it is a solid and entertaining film that shows that well-balanced humor with action and an interesting plot can make a big difference, this movie feels like 2 tapes, on the one hand the heroic and full of action and on the other hand the serious and political issues within your world</review-text>

		<review-text>Here's the thing. The crux of most of this movie is the black experience told from various angles. If all you're interested in is fight sequences and cars blowing up, then this is not the movie for you. If you're interested in watching a story about abandonment, colonialism, nationalism, and other complex topics then this is the movie for you. If you are unfamiliar with the black experience and black culture then yes this movie may go over your head and you may view it as boring. I'm NOT saying this is only for black people, but to understand the essence of a complex movie like this you need to understand black culture and history. I won't even get started on talking about how impactful this movie is for young black people to see themselves as heroes and as the majority and not the minority on the big screen, I'll be typing a whole dissertation lol.The acting is pretty solid. Cinematography &amp; wardrobe were fantastic. I really think the unsung hero is Winston Duke. He's got some great acting chops and a firm grasp on African mannerisms. I hope to see more of him soon. Other than that, it's a pretty solid movie and I'll probably see it again.</review-text>

		<review-text>As a White person I was apprehensive going into this film, as I'd heard rumors it would contain some anti-White sentiment. But I was pleasantly surprised to find the film mostly just contains positive and empowering messages of Ethnic Solidarity and National Pride for Black people.The fictional African nation of Wakanda is a racially homogeneous ethno-state, yet its people also still feel solidarity with their fellow Africans throughout the continent. A key part of the plot is the question of will the Wakandans keep their advanced technology for themselves, or will they share it will their fellow Africans, while still retaining their national sovereignty and identity. This, I believe, is a wonderful message that I as a White person could relate to. Its not anti-White, just pro-Black.Malcolm X would have loved this film.</review-text>

		<review-text>This time I agree with the same old cliche dialogue &quot;The best marvel movie till date&quot; Undoubtedly the best standalone movie made by marvel studios.The story starts right after the events happened in CA : Civil War. The movie starts in slow pace, but once the Killmonger gets introduced the story shifted into a fast pace momentum. Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa scores just like he did in Civil war. But the real performer - Michael B Jordan plays the brutal Killmonger steals the show especially in the climax area.The movie is well balanced with right amount action and humor. No one liners or jokes in between battles. Cinematography is another one which eligible for a round of applause.The way they showed Wakanda.So much detailing in every aspect. With a perfect color tone, well managed CGI and some kick ass stunts the entire movie delivers a different experience for me.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is pretty run-of-the-mill Disney/Marvel if you take it at face value. However, with its somewhat Shakespearian plot combined with themes about the dangers of isolationism it brings with it a few takes on the superhero-blockbuster formula that feels fresh and captivating. It's one of those rare Disney/Marvel movies that stands on its own feet instead of being a 2-hour set up for the next project in line.On top of that Black Panther also takes a couple of well deserved jabs at social injustices as well as both &quot;old-school&quot; western imperialism and modern western imperialism. The jabs may be modest and somewhat unsophisticated (which is to be expected when it comes to movies made and released on this scale) but at least they are still there, and that is something I very much appreciate!Script, pacing, acting, CGI etc. strikes me as above average overall so no complaints there. In short, Black Panther is well worth a watch and hopefully something that might contribute to Disney/Marvel upping their game yet another step in the future.</review-text>

		<review-text>For a character, whom, even just a couple of years ago, people had known nothing about, Black Panther created quite an appreciable amount of hype and expectation and lived up to it all. Marvel's latest release packs a lot of exhilarating action with imaginative and vibrant visuals and a detailed plot. It is the story of an African prince from the fictitious nation of Wakanda, thrown in the face of kingship after the sudden death of his father, having to deal with his new found responsibilities, rivals and an unexpected enemy with a connection to his own past. This movie may not be exactly an origin story as it is not the first time we see this character but it checks all the boxes for qualifying as one and from the string of all of the recent ones we've seen, this may as well be the best. Breaking away from formulaic Marvel (which I love too) Black Panther immerses itself in the climate of a foreign land and stays true to the heart and culture of Africa. Every part of the film is very well thought out in terms of visual detail and since the story is of the mythological kind, there is almost a fairytale-like charm we feel, when watching the film walk down very similar lanes. Black Panther's character also gives us throwback vibes of James Bond as he is mostly decked with high tech gadgets and suits with even a car that need not be directly driven by him (Tomorrow Never Dies, anyone?). Applaudable character development has become second nature to a Marvel production and we see that tradition being continued very diligently here too. Chadwick Boseman obviously dazzles in the titular role and manages to balance the intricacies of his character's delicate nature and strong determination and power skillfully. But everyone around him is equally valuable to the story too and it never feels like the film was being borne on the shoulders of the lead only. In fact, without the rest of his team which includes a lot of fiery women, he would probably have died. There aren't many jaw dropping twists in this film although a significant one occurs at the interval where the story changes course. The movie deals with some very relatable and often contentious political issues too, that the lead deals with as a result of him becoming the king of his country but with the truth of his very own existence being shrouded in secrecy, it gets a lot harder for him to do the right thing. Thus, watching him mature into the leader that his people need is an enjoyable experience. The villain is challenging and tests the limits of the hero's abilities which is what shows us how human the latter really is and how sometimes, that and loyalty is enough to overcome any obstacle.On the whole Black Panther is a layered film with diverse aspects just like the soul and culture of the place it is set in. It will leave you with the excitement of Infinity War, too, as the mid-credits and post-credits scenes set up, to some extent, the prologue of the upcoming climactic extravaganza.</review-text>

	<review id="495">
		<review-text>'Black Panther' has received a lot of hype surround it being the first superhero film with a black leading man (even though that mantel probably should have gone to 1997's 'Spawn,' but it is correct at least in terms of the current Marvel Shared Universe). However, I really don't believe its success will have much to do with anything so shallow. In short: it's a modern day Marvel film and, if you're a regular at the multiplexes, you'll probably already know what to expect: a hero with superpowers taking on - basically - an evil version of themselves. So, if that's what you're into (and current Box Office trends says that many of us are!) then you're going to enjoy this just as much as 'Iron Man, Thor' and all the others. The reason: it's just a cool, colourful, charismatic film which is great to eat popcorn to.It's set just after 'Captain America: Civil War,' but perhaps one of the first things I should mention is that you don't really need to have seen any other films in the MCU to fully understand everything that happens here. We meet up with King T'Challa of (fictional African nation) Wakanda who, along with ruling his nation since the recent death of his father, also moonlights as the super-powered 'Black Panther,' who, as yet, has kept his and his country's 'special' abilities a secret from the rest of the world. Now, faced with exposure of just what Wakanda is capable of, he is faced with whether to continue its current way of existing, or enter the fray (which will no doubt take him further into the path of the Avengers and their exploits).So, there's nothing new in terms of plot, but it's definitely a distant cousin of the recent Marvel movie 'Thor: Ragnarok' in terms of its look and feel. It's very colouring to look at (nothing DC-like by being all 'dark and gritty' here!) - you may even say its looks like a 'living comic book!). It's a great-looking film visually, but, if you're being overly-critical, you could say that there's a little too much CGI, especially in the backdrops. I know this is a criticism levelled at all 'fantastical' films where whole new planets/civilisations have to be created, but sometimes you can tell the King is talking to someone up against a greenscreen.Also, it's worth noting that there isn't - quite - as much humour in this film as other recent Marvel entries. I guess this is down to - sort of - handicapping its leading man by making him a King. Before, we've had leading men who are gods/thieves/playboy billionaires - all of whom are allowed the freedom to let a witty quip roll of their tongues at a moment's notice. However, here, if the Black Panther did that, it would probably feel a little out of character. Luckily, the film makes up for this by surrounding him with a stellar supporting cast who are well-schooled in letting off steam with a one-liner or two.Overall, 'Black Panther' is just another excellent and enjoyable thrill ride in the Marvel universe. Don't expect anything too deep or revolutionary - just expect a good time and be prepared to bow at not just His Majesty - the King of Wakanda - but also yet another amazingly-successful in a film franchise that never seems to be able to run out of steam.</review-text>

		<review-text>This breathtaking film is set in a future Africa that is under-developed, except for the all-Black nation of Wakanda - secretly the most technologically advanced in the world - which is ruled by monarch T'Challa, who assumes the throne after the death of his father.T'Challa's goal as leader is to secure the existence of his people and a future for their children. He will face both treachery from within, and the ever-present threat of invasion or colonialization from without. His challenge will be to ensure his nation holds on to its sovereignty and way of life, while also meeting the demands of his brother Africans to use Wakanda's technological advancement for the good of all.I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen it, but I will say that I found it empowering, moving, and thought-provoking (even as a person of no color). It really made me think.(The film does contain some medicinal herb use and violence)</review-text>

		<review-text>I must say I am slightly biased because Marvel movies are my favorite movies but WOW. Black Panther is a really great movie. It has a great story with some unexpected twists. It is a great script that was brought to life by a phenomenal cast. Chadwick Boseman is a perfect T'Challa and Black Panther. Micheal B Jordan provides a great performance as Erik Killmonger and the character has really good depth and a back story that makes him a convincing Bad Guy, possibly the greatest MCU villain we've seen yet. T'Challa's little sister Shuri steals many of the scenes she is in. Wakanda is beautiful and the movie was beautiful. Black Panther is made up of a predominately African American cast as it should be and provides and rich culture and shows us what an African nation would look like if it wasn't conquered. This is very much a political movie as it is a superhero movie. The fight scenes were mostly great and well choreographed. Some little weaknesses were the CGI wasn't perfect and it was a bit slow at the beginning. There are 2 after credit scenes that are both important. But I will be seeing this movie again in theaters. #WakandaForever</review-text>

		<review-text>The classic Black Panther story returns, with the new edge in terms of tech and talent (no spoilers). The original storyline leaves substantial room for strong female characters -- and we have the amazing Angela Basset at the helm for this. The entire cast does a really amazing job and the special effects are exceptional. Points off for the execution of the multiple spirit world scenes, which could have been much less &quot;Lion King,&quot; especially given the amazing job done in the rest of the film. Despite this, the movie ranks highly for me as a great action-adventure film for the whole family.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black panther is a good blockbuster pushed to greatness by its importance as a cultural milestone. As far as the recent movies from marvel go, Black Panther is a stand out in how it goes beyond entertainment to dig deeper than most superhero blockbusters. The political statements of a film based in African culture and heritage are main themes and are addressed but manage not to be heavy handed. It can't be ignored, the cultural importance of a movie rooted so deeply in African American culture with important figures of that community coming from all different mediums to create this movie. While its easy for the film to become wrapped up in the statements that it makes within the context of our society, it also functions as one of the better products of marvels fail proof formula. As all marvel films, the characters are a strength, each is compelling and the villains are especially well done, a feat that marvel has struggled with in the past. The action sequences are creative and through all of the quips and jokes there are some genuine heartfelt moments. In the end Black Panther is an enjoyable movie elevated by what it means in a broader context.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is a stunning first solo outing for its title character that wowed me with its strong ensemble cast, inventive visuals and multi-layered story. Black Panther follows T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), King of Wakanda, an advanced and highly powerful territory that is disguised as a third-world country. He also protects his nation and its people as a masked vigilante called the Black Panther. After the death of his father, T'Challa is chosen to take the throne and receive the powers of the panther god. Just after his extravagant coronation, a threat finds its way into Wakanda's borders by Erik Killmonger. Killmonger is a fierce and skilled soldier who wishes to replace T'Challa and usher in a new age for the country. T'Challa will be tested and must protect the throne from Killmonger.My favorite character is Shuri (Letitia Wright), T'Challa's whizkid sister who helps him maintain the mantle of Black Panther and stay one step ahead of the villains he faces. Letitia Wright delivers hilarious one-liners with near perfect timing. She nails the rapport between Shuri and her brother, interacting in a way that is both believable and develops both their characters.An outstanding performance in this film comes from Michael B. Jordan who is brilliant as Killmonger. He abandons the genre's usual vague &quot;destroy-the-world&quot; motivation and creates a genuinely complicated character. Jordan has cutthroat moments that make you dread his presence, but his sinister manner is evened out by moments where you come to sympathize with his character.The deep, emotional part of the film's story is unexpected and caught me by surprise. It is an important moment for the main character and what drives his actions for the rest of the film. Sometimes, these comic-book heroes make poor decisions and have to fight against their own demons as well as the bad guys. This has been done before in both comics and film, but here we really see T'Challa change through his experiences. I recommend this film to ages 12 to 18. There is some action and violence with spears and swords that feels more violent than what I'm used to from comic book films. I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars. Black Panther is easily one of the greatest comic-book films I've seen. Period.Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.</review-text>

		<review-text>I honestly would've rated it closer to an 8.5 or 9, but I gave it a 10 to try to help balance out against the obvious racist trolls. To be honest most of the criticism I see about the movie is based on people not liking how &quot;black&quot; it is. The action was incredible, some of the best in any MCU movie yet. Black Panther himself is a great addition to the roster and things like the black panther ceremony among other things were great shout outs to the comic fans. Michael B Jordan as Killmonger would've been the best (he still argueabley is) villain they've had yet. I only wish they'd built him up a little more on screen, but his acting was great and the story behind him was a refreshing take on a villain. Marvel movies aren't meant to be Oscar worthy movies, they're feel good action blockbusters with some comedy thrown in, and they knocked it out of the park with this</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther, much like Civil War, is not only a fun superhero movie with fantastic action scenes, it's a movie with a message! I won't spoil it, but it has one! Black Panther was a blast from start to finish! The acting was great, especially from Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan! The film has the best villain in an MCU movie since Loki, he has one of the best backstories I've seen in a long time! The story is simple, but it works! Seriously, people always expect a deep and complex story, it's always hard to satisfy people. The action scenes, while can be a bit dark sometimes, are still fantastic and tons of fun to watch! If you're looking for a fun action/superhero movie, Black Panther is definitely for you! It's a must see for Marvel fans! Seriously people, not everything has to be The Dark Knight!</review-text>

		<review-text>Amazing film, this film follows some of the other recent Marvel film e.g. Deadpool and Spiderman homecoming because it was partly very funny which worked fantastically within the story line. 
The cast was amazing and I loved the fact that 99% of the accents were African because it added something different to the Marvel universe. 
The reason why I did not give Black Panther a 10/10 is because I felt like there was not enough fighting scenes within the film, not only were the fighting scenes very short but there were not enough of these.
Overall, the director did an insane job with this film and it will be talked about for many years to come, this film is a MUST WATCH for anyone that has not watched it and likes the Marvel universe.</review-text>

		<review-text>I believe that I was 20 and in college when I first came across the Black Panther, the first black superhero of any historical significance and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby for Marvel Comics in 1966, and in the adventure I read about he was searching the world for his future bride - and eventually found her in the Kenyan Ororo Munroe/Storm (of the X-Men). In his travels, he also came across other noteworthy black superheroes including Brother Voodoo, Luke Cage/Power Man, The Falcon, Monica Rambeau/Pulsar and my personal favorite superhero of color, the vampire hunter Blade.(As most readers of my reviews know, Spider-Man is my all-time favorite superhero.)This was 12 years ago, I would say, and the Black Panther has come a long way since then.Ryan Coogler's (&quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; &quot;Creed&quot;) &quot;Black Panther&quot; arrives in a 2018 dominated by racial and social debate (and controversy) - not unlike the time that the Black Panther character first debuted at the height of the Civil Rights Movement in the mid-1960s. The Black Panther first appeared in a two-part origin story - &quot;Fantastic Four #52&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Four #53&quot; (July 1966-August 1966) - and there he single-handedly defeated the Fantastic Four in order to test his skills in preparation for his battle with his arch-nemesis Ulysses Klaw. Black Panther later became one of the Fantastic Four's closest allies, as well as a member of the Avengers.&quot;Black Panther,&quot; the film, has many firsts going for it. It would be the first superhero film with a black director (Coogler), the first superhero film with a largely black cast (and featuring white actors in roles usually reserved for minorities), the first superhero film to display an entirely fictional African culture and civilization in a positive non-stereotypical light, and of course it's a superhero film about the first black superhero ever created. It achieves many of its objectives, even if every now and then it slips into some of the corniness and silly comedy that I believe has come to define many modern superhero movies since Disney acquired Marvel nearly a decade ago.&quot;Black Panther&quot; is in some respects quite different from most big-budgeted superhero epics of late. The film has a decidedly political slant to it, which I see that some viewers have already commented negatively about. This doesn't give me some of the pause that it should have, and, after viewing the film for myself, I saw that these politics aim to address a key issue that I've often wondered myself about the Black Panther, and his home country - the fictional African nation of Wakanda, which is the most technologically advanced civilization on Earth.The Black Panther is, of course, the King of Wakanda, and his real name is T'Challa (played here by the mesmerizing Chadwick Boseman). In &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016), that was where the Black Panther was first introduced into the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and in his first outing his father, the previous Black Panther and king of Wakanda, was killed in a terrorist bombing. Now as the new king of Wakanda, T'Challa finds himself tasked with the enormous burden of being leader to his country and his people, who have remained socially isolated from the rest of the world and become the most technologically advanced country not just on the African continent, but possibly the whole world.Wakanda has managed to thrive, and survive, hundreds of years without having to face the horrors of colonization and exploitation by outside forces, by those who want what has led to Wakanda's vast wealth and technological prowess - the alien metal vibranium. But all this is about to change with the arrival of arms dealer Ulysses Klaw (Andy Serkis). But Klaw is merely a puppet in the scheme of Eric Stevens (Coogler regular Michael B. Jordan), a former U.S. military black ops mercenary and hired assassin who now goes by the name &quot;Killmonger,&quot; to lay claim to the Wakandan throne. It turns out that Killmonger also has a tragic connection to the Black Panther's past.I have to say that I was quite well impressed by &quot;Black Panther.&quot; Some of the early comments I had heard about the film were proven true. The one that stuck out to me the most was the villain Killmonger. Going back to what I said earlier about this film's politics, the character of Killmonger presents an argument about his motivations for villainy that are hard to counter: he forces Wakanda to face up to its greatest moral contradiction, which is its isolationism. His goals are just as much political as they are personal, and this gives him some much-needed dramatic and emotional dimensions to not make him seem like so many bland and poorly defined super-villains of recent memory. That is what I appreciated most in Michael B. Jordan's ruthless, yet ultimately sympathetic, portrayal of such a dangerous and fascinating character.The film has the usual sensational special effects-driven action scenes that are cool-looking but tend to distract from a film outing that had a lot of firsts going for it, and could have been very different from most other superhero films of the last decade. (Coogler, as the film's co-screenwriter, was at least wise enough to not serve up every other piece of dialogue as a punchline.) The Black Panther, to me, would have worked a lot better if it was a stand-alone picture and not part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but what can I do?Ultimately, &quot;Black Panther&quot; did not disappoint. Ryan Coogler had a huge task ahead of him when he made this film and despite a few faults, he delivered. &quot;Black Panther&quot; will undoubtedly win the weekend, if not an entirely new generation of young Marvel Comics readers.9/10</review-text>

	<review id="512">
		<review-text>I saw &quot;Black Panther&quot;, starring Chadwick Boseman-Gods of Egypt, Draft Day; Michael B. Jordon-Creed, Fantastic Four_2015; Lupita Nyong'o-Star Wars:The Force Awakens, 12 Years a Slave; Danai Gurira-The Walking Dead_tv, All Eyez On Me and Andy Serkis-Star Wars:The Force Awakens, The Lord of the Rings movies.
This is based on a comic book hero that has been around since 1966, when he made his first appearance in a Fantastic Four comic. FYI: His debut was about 2 months before the militant Black Panther Party made their debut, so there was no connection between the two. Chadwick plays T'Challa, the son of the King of Wakanda, an East African country that is more than it appears to be. They have a precious metal called Vibranium that powers their whole country. They use it for all sorts of technological wonders; weapons, transportation, medicinal, etc. Vibranium can absorb and then refocus energy and it was even used in making Captain Americas' shield. When his father dies-as seen in Captain America:Civil War, Chadwick's first cinematic appearance-Chadwick returns to become King, and the new Black Panther, as was his father before him. That's when multiple problems start hitting the fan. First, Andy steals some Vibranium and Chadwick has to try and stop him-the policy of Wakanda is to keep their high technology a big secret from the outside world, so as to prevent misuse of the metal. Then Michael shows up, claiming to be the rightful heir to the Wakandian throne and challenges Chadwick to a fight. Lupita plays Chadwick's love interest and Danai is the head of security for Chadwick. Stan Lee pops up in his customary cameo-look for him in the casino scene-and there are 2 scenes at the end. The first is right after the end credits start and the second one is at the very end, so make sure you stay until the very end-it has a familiar character show up.
It's rated &quot;PG-13&quot; for action, violence and a rude gesture and it has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 14 minutes.
As you might guess, I loved this movie and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</review-text>

		<review-text>As is the case with the law of averages, the what some would call the law of the inevitable, we just keep waiting for the day in which Marvel makes the wrong move but that day continues to feel like a far off, near impossibility, as the superhero empire (with help from the Mouse House) continue to unleash quality and more risky products like it's no big deal at all.Continuing on the trend with what could well be their biggest risk from outside the normal yet, Ryan Coogler's Black Panther may not mess with the well-worn superhero narrative formula but thanks to Coogler's pitch-perfect direction, a brilliant cast that all seem committed and a passionate representation of African culture embedded into an otherwise generic set-up, this Marvel event is going to become a quick favourite of many right around the world.First appearing in this current format in Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther see's Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa/Black Panther become king of secretive African nation Wakanda and fighting the good fight to keep his country's order in place while he tries to stop Andy Serkis's arms dealer Ulysses Klaue from trading into the precious commodity of vibranium and stop Michael B. Jordan's nefarious Killmonger from gaining anymore traction in his quest to make Wakanda his own.There's really nothing overly special about this story, one that plays out as you would expect it to, but Coogler who showed such talent with his debut Fruitvale Station and his bigger budgeted follow-up Creed instils his film with a true sense of heart and purpose and full-credit to him and Marvel for allowing Black Panther's roots in the African culture to take full effect here.Thanks to Coogler's guidance, the country of Wakanda and the beautifully realised settings and production design of Black Panther make it Marvel's most visually captivating film yet (sorry Ragnarok) and combined with a selection of Kendrick Lamar's tailored songs, this is Marvel at its most technically and aesthetically proficient.All this technical prowess and impressive direction would be for naught if Coogler and his ensemble failed to meet but as his proved with his previous films, Coogler once again shows himself a filmmaker well in-tuned to his actors.Led by the impressive Boseman, Black Panther's much-publicised predominately African-American cast all work together to create Marvel's best team-up outside of the Avengers and Guardians and the Galaxy, with a highlight coming in the form of Michael B. Jordan's key-bad Killmonger.Killmonger (real name Erik Stevens) is Marvel's most impressive villain outside of Loki, with Jordan doing a fantastic job at bringing this tormented and in some ways justified character to life and whenever his on screen, Black Panther elevates itself to greater heights.Killmonger's anger and resentment to what has happened to him and his people is more powerful than your average superhero alien looking to take over Earth for no real-reason and with this, Coogler's film has some powerful things to say about the world in which we live, not often the case with a comic-book adaptation.It's actually the films biggest downfall in many ways that it doesn't utilise Jordan more in its 2 hour plus runtime and had it managed to squeeze more of Jordan's escapades into its sometimes more slowly paced and methodical opening half, Black Panther could've become something undeniable and memorably special.Final Say - Re-writing the rulebook with its casting and socially relevant themes, Black Panther may not reinvent the superhero staple but it's a fresh and often exciting new addition to the Marvel universe that's deserving of its likely box-office dominance, making Black Panther a king well-deserving of its spot on the throne.4 armoured rhino's out of 5</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is a fun and entertaining marvel movie. The acting is good, the plot is good and the villain has actually some good points. There is not as much humor in this as it was in &quot;Guardians of the galaxy&quot; but there is still some. Some of it lands, some of it does not.But is this a revoulationary movie from Marvel? No. It's basically what you would expect from a marvel movie. It's bit different of course, with the setting and the fact that almost the entire cast is black. But besides the cast, this really is not something we haven't seen before. That being said, this was still a very entertaining and fun superhero movie! So if you like Marvel movies I would recommend this, but if you are kinda tired of the marvel formula I would say there really is not any reason to see it.</review-text>

		<review-text>There is something about the characters created by Marvel Comics (thanks to Stan Lee). Every character has its own struggle to rise to fame and stumble down heavily. But as they say &quot; A hero must rise from the ashes of Phoenix&quot; to become more stronger and wiser than before, Black Panther is one such tale that needs to heard.Black Panther is an enigmatic story of a Prince T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) who is on the verge of becoming a King after his father dies in terrorist bombing. T'Challa returns home to take control of the kingdom of Wakhanda, an isolated African nation which has the resource in form of Vibranium that can change the shape of the world. However, T'Challa is challenged by his cousin Erik Killmonger, who was abandoned in his childhood when his father was killed. From the director of marvelous films like Creed and Fruitvale Station, Ryan Coogler proves that he is one such fine young talented guy who can transform a script into a must-see film. The first half is fast-paced and makes you glued to the screen with high-voltage drama followed by superbly executed car-chasing scene in Tokyo. We are also introduced to new characters like Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ulysses Klaw (brilliantly played by Andy Serkis). The movie takes a sweet turn and second half becomes little monotonous with fall of King Of Wakhanda. The length of the film takes a backseat while editing could have been better. The saving grace is marked by a good comeback of Black Panther a.k.a King Of Wakhanda with a strong climax scene. As usual, there is a scene once the movie ends and a final scene after the entire credit rolls out. Visual effects are superb while Cinematography is excellent. Screenplay is very good and should be lauded for keeping us engaged throughout. Ryan Coogler does a good job in defining each character with aplomb. Each actor has done justice their role which makes the movie even better. But I felt, Andy Serkis stood out as Ulysses Klaw. The brilliant actor was mind-blowing in a small role and I wish the makers could have kept his characters alive for some more time.Overall, Black Panther has the right ingredients to keep you entertained. It turned out to be better than what I was expecting. Excellent 4/5</review-text>

The characters are complex without being contradictory - I actually felt sympathy for the bad guys at times. Complex cultural issues are presented without being heavy-handed or preachy. Should a country be isolationist? When do you betray a friend? your country? When is it okay to question authority? your mentor? your parent? All smoothly admixed with stunning visuals, awesome action scenes, and a touch of humor. The costumes are unique and beautiful on all genders. And the prominent and integral role of the women is impressive, especially for an action movie. The 4DX platform is icing on the cake. Black Panther delivers 100% as a Marvel movie and as an action movie. I look forward to seeing more movies about these characters soon!</review-text>

		<review-text>Marvel has been on a streak of good superhero and I'm pretty sure they managed to outdo their work compared to DC Comics. Seeing Black Panther in Captain America Civil War was amazing and I was looking forward to seeing him in an actual film.So this takes place right after Captain America Civil War when T'Challa returns back to this nation Wakanda after his father dies in an attack. While there, he decides to take his throne and rule Wakanda until suddenly a powerful enemy N'Jakada invades the nation and has intentions of destroying Wakanda. How T'Challa defeats N'Jakanda and protects the nation of Waanda is basically what this film is all about.Creed fame Ryan Coogler introduces a superhero film also &quot;the first black superhero&quot; of marvel (not racist but praising Marvel for their generosity of how much respect they're showing towards human race). His script was abit of a dissapointment because the movie had a very predictable story and eventually after 45 minutes of the film, the audience will for sure find out what will happen to N'Jakanda. The pacing was a bit slow but that still doesn't shy away for mbeing a perfect.Luckily there things that were integral to Black Panther such as showing a science fictional version of Africa to traditional clothing. The VFX was fantastic and that is all hats off to MS (Marvel Studios). The look of Busan and Wakanda was just commendable and delightful to watch on the big screen. The action was well choreographed and seeing Marvel with their remarkable efforts doesn't lack justice.Acting was a phenomenon. Chad Boswick playing T'Challa/Black Panther will just knock your socks off. He was exhilirating and edgy which proves how he is superhero material. Michael B Jordan was the major highlight of the film and his villainous attempt as N'Jakande shows a perfect match of subtlety. Lupita Noyong'o and seeing her as the African spy was defintiely worth devouring espcially how she manages to come clean with ther accent.Overall, this film may not be perfect because of the average writing but the entertainment of it is something the audience should go and experience. 3.75/5 - Atleast it is a perfect film for the audience.</review-text>
		<review-title>Generic writing but still a perfect film especially for Marvel.</review-title>

		<review-text>The film was a nice addition to the ever expanding mcu, it opens up new things to look at now in the mcu just like what Thor did, Guardians Of The Galaxy, I like the villain Erik Killmonger I though he was great and at times the film tried to make us feel sorry for him because of his father being killed by the father of T'Challa, also Klaue was great as a villain but if you have Andy Serkis playing as a villain then it always is gonna be great. There was a moment that was a bit rushed in my opinion is that when they found black panther again, he was killed in ritual combat against Erik Killmonger and got pushed of the waterfall but it seems like it was only a couple minutes later that it was like, oh hey we found him again and he's alive, Hooray, and because of that we only saw killmonger as king for about 10 minutes, I would've liked to see more of him as king of Wakanda and show how evil of a king he is, especially after when the film seemed to make him look like the hero and everyone else the villain, we didn't see the soul stone which annoyed me a bit because now it's probably gonna rushed in infinity war when they are explaining what it does but u still do believe that is in Wakanda because why else would there be a massive attack there unless Thanos wants the Vibranioum, overall the film was brilliant and plot was great showing how tough it really is to be a king of a country and enemy's you may encounter on the way, the film had humour almost like any other mcu film, and the cast was great.</review-text>

		<review-text>Whether or not one feels it is 'overhyped' it truly is an enjoyable movie with a wonderful story at the base and beautiful imagery. I feel sorry those that choose to negatively critique every detail and nuance of the film because they wanted to go in not liking it from the start...they truly missed out on just an enjoyable and entertaining film. This wasn't meant to be a epic drama it is a superhero fantasy film for all to enjoy. It is a shame it has to be pushed and pulled to meet some unattainable standard. It's entertainment there are certainly worst movies and could arguably be one of the better ones; but this doesn't deserve a one star as you see there are reviewers intent on keeping the ratings lower than what it truly deserves. Keeping in context this a fantasy superhero film then I feel it deserves every last one of the 10 stars. I hope MCU continues to develop this character and continues to offer the world yet another perspective on what a superhero can be and continue to nurture and develop this character and storyline with the same depth and compassion presented in this film. A superhero can be badass and also have compassion as one their super strengths...which in today's world actually is a super divine power since it seems to be lacking in many. Let people but most of all let the kids enjoy the movie and stop hating I never saw a movie where people purposely are coming at it negatively because of obvious reasons a movie given the circumstances they would not have cared to review about one way or the other; however THE TRUE SPIRIT OF THE MOVIE AND STORY WILL PREVAIL!</review-text>

		<review-text>Ok when to see this movie with not may hypes, for me was another Marvel movie with a hero that we didn't know well. Only saw him at Civil war and that it is all. So Prince and King T ' Challa of Wakanda what an amazing back ground history they have give us. This movies is not for those that are expecting a lot of actions with no explanation, This movie was direct to give us the vide that was creating another phase in Marvel. The color , the special effect where amazing but over all the history was the most that I took from this movie. I love how the represent their traditions, their culture and that important of family unity. Prince or King T'Challa was amazing , now is understandable why they didn't cast any one else for this role he is Black Panther. As the lead role he make me felt all types of emotions watching the movie. He was just great I haven't other words to describe his excellent role.As his love interested , I was amazing how they play with the character, she was an important support character, but you can also see that she was special for him. Making her an spy that care for people well been outside of the city of Wakanda, was a magic touch. She represent what other cannot see the reality of 3 world countries. The Slavery and trade of woman and children's for sexual favor.There was two part that brought me back to my childhood favor movie Lion King and that only make even felt in love more with the movie. It was so much rich in almost everything.
The important that it to show to others the traditions and morals rights . This movie nail and that what make one of my top 5 marvel movies.
I am hoping the sequel touch even more reality that people live and suffer in the African continent.</review-text>

		<review-text>I think this movie has a lot of mixed user ratings because we all hyped this movie up way too much. I think the excitement of a mostly-black movie got the best of us. We all wanted this movie to succeed. Luckily, before watching the movie, I saw some terrible reviews. Thus, I went into the movie with lowered expectations. THIS HELPED A LOT! Go into the movie with lowered expectations and you will be pleasantly surprised.I enjoyed the change of scenery with the marvel universe. It was awesome to see a highly successful African country. I liked that no other avengers were involved in this movie as well. There was so much to explain with T'Challa. The movie was very visually appealing. Some of the CGI got out of hand, but that's to be expected in any Disney film. Contrary to most of these reviews, I liked the character development (at least with Killmonger and T'Challa). Killmonger had very valid reasons for his motivation to be the &quot;bad guy.&quot; T'Challa was torn between following his ancestors and expanding to help others. Both characters could be sympathized with.What makes this an 8.5 for me is that it felt a little long. It probably could've been shortened by about 10 minutes. Along with that, the climax of the movie felt a little bland. The ending was meant to be a little heart-wrenching because T'Challa killed his blood relative, but the moment just wasn't fully captured (maybe it was the lack of climactic music?). Other than these things, the movie was enjoyable.</review-text>
		<review-title>Solid 8.5..GO INTO IT W/LOWERED EXPECTATIONS</review-title>

		<review-text>Another Marvelous weekend is here and it holds another Disney branded film to be released into the local theaters. The superhero theme of the weekend strays from the normal leads you've seen in the last few years, one who has more ferocity than the usual crew, maybe outside of the Hulk. Yes, I'm talking about Black Panther, and after much anticipation it is here and ready to unleash the cat within. Does this highly awaited film meet expectations? Robbie K is here to help out, with yet another movie review. Sit back, relax, and read on as I help out with your movie going pleasures. LIKES:The Cinematography: A good hero movie requires good visuals to bring it to life, and Black Panther reigns supreme on this level. After some unique storytelling art at the beginning, the movie resorts to beautiful blends of real-life, breathtaking shots and impressive visuals. The movie drops you into what feels like a technologically advanced city, complete with James Bond like gadgets that feel super in themselves. Black Panther's camerawork is also very dynamic, energetic enough to increase the action, but contained enough to not leaving you nauseous or confused. The Acting: Marvel movies sometimes tank in this section, but again Black Panther raises the bar on this level. Chadwick Boseman retains the regality of T'Challa from Civil War but adds more conflict and growth to the character as he struggles with the mantle of king. Michael B. Jordan comes back with a fire, once again showing that he earns his spot in Hollywood with an emotionally charged performance that seethes with that raw edge. Lupita Nyong'o brings the balance to the movie, portraying a character that acts as a solid bridge between all parties, keeping her dynamic performance balanced at the same time, while Danai Gurira grounds the characters down with her strong will and fantastic stage combat skills. Letitia Wright is the comedy of the film who has a fantastic delivery of the well-written lines this movie has. Almost all parties involved nailed their roles, with the chemistry between everyone favorably mixing to create what felt like a tribe. Fantastic job casting director. The Comedy: Marvel is all about making you laugh, sometimes making that the focus of the film and other times as a nice add-on. Black Panther took the latter for me and was tastefully done to perhaps be one of the best executions of the Marvel Universe. In this darker movie, there is a lot of tension and raw nerves exposed in the Savannah drama, with many negative emotions running rampant like the predators of the plains. Yet, intermixed in this intensity is comedic gold, or vibranium in this case, well-placed to maximize laughs and clever to avoid the usual slapstick staleness that plagues most movies. This style of comedy didn't detract from the movie but added another layer to help reset the tension and keep you engaged in the movie from start to finish. Plus, you've got a nice combination of styles in store as well, so two thumbs up for that. The Emotion in the Story: The movie does not have the most unique story, something hard to accomplish in this age of saturation. Yet this Marvel version of the Lion King is packed with so many moments to send one into an emotional fervor, sending you on a roller coaster ride of feelings. Black Panther will be inspiring to many, bringing approving claps and motivation to change the world. It's a moral filled tale that brings out the dynamic use of technology, the importance of family, and the dilemmas of a new king having to face. While I'm not the biggest supporter of dramas, Black Panther manages to make the drama feel less soap opera like that many movies fail to avoid. The Ending: Many f Marvel's movies often fail to find that satisfying ending to conclude the awesome tale. Black Panther, manages to keep everything going from start to finish and brings all the building tension to full boil with an exciting climax. All the characters are brought into the mix, having some involvement in the conflict at hand, as they fight in impressive choreographed battles. And while our combatants dance in the virtual field, the story continues to progress and the characters develop with each swing of the weapon. It utilizes all the elements that they had developed during the movie, which goes to show story telling is still alive. DISLIKES:Impressionable Hate: More of a warning, the main villain is not only skilled and deadly, but has a surprising amount of hate contained in his chiseled body. Killmonger is a character that has a lot of issues, and his plot to change the world is something that can motivate impressionable minds down the wrong avenue. Be careful when taking friends and younger audience members to the film who have difficulty understanding character flaws. Martin Freeman: The movie did an okay job with the former hobbit, but I expected a lot more from Freeman's character. Though there is some comic relief, and a little action with his character, Freeman really didn't feel that pertinent to the story until near the very end. Such a legendary actor deserved some more relevance to the plot, some extra comedy, or at least some better development to justify the price tag that comes with him. Not the weakest character mind you, but not what I expected. More Action: No surprise, Robbie want's more action in his Marvel movie. With Black Panther, I had worried that most of the excitement was ruined in the trailers, especially with a huge gap between those action-packed sequences. Had it not been for the ending, I would have been disappointed in this quality, but still I wanted more to be unleashed in this movie to put T'Challa's skills to the test. The VERDICT:  Black Panther is by far one of the better Marvel films to grace the theaters and shows promise for the future of the series. The tale has fantastic visuals to bring the world to life, alongside amazing writing and acting to further bring Wakanda to the playing field. It keeps its characters engaged and fills the 2-hour 15-minute run time with an emotional fervor to keep you integrated into every aspect until that incredible ending sequence. However, the movie still has a few limitations including needing a little more action, a dab more of Martin Freeman's relevance, and a slight decrease in predictability to make this a perfect film in the Marvel universe. Still, the film gets massive props for reviving the Marvel movement this year. So definitely get out there and see Black Panther and unleash the beast that dwells within all us comic book fans. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0</review-text>

		<review-text>#blackpanther (2nd review) - Contains strong content based on the #blackhistory and the colonization together with struggles in world politics. This time, Marvel comes with a serious movie compared to their previous three movies such as Dr. Stranger (2016), Spider-Man Homecoming &amp; Thor Ragnorak both were in 2017 to prepare the audience the audience mindset for getting ready to Avengers #infinitywar . Black Panther also will be the best film of Marvel Cinematic Universe since Iron Man (2008) &amp;Captain America The Winter Soldier (2014). My first review was just simple because it was after premiere so today is the official release around worldwide.</review-text>

		<review-text>Well first of all lower your expectations: this is not THE BEST Marvel movie but keeps up the bar set by the Captain America ones. This is not a movie that will &quot;redeem the african culture&quot; as hyped in media, as it's more of the same MCU showed so far in terms of script. So yeah the main cast is black, and they're impressive at it: the script doesn't cartoon them like other films in the past but, c'mon, they might as well be Sakaarians, they still feel like comic book characters.This is a love song, not a warsong. The movie is both personal and consistent with the universe Marvel created, and there's nothing wrong with that unless you hate superhero comics in general. It's no more politically loaded than The Winter Soldier and Civil War were, as it just scrapes world issues the presence of superheroes and supervillains would both benefit and harm. The script is not the strong point, though it's also not bad, and it gives as in all MCU movies much respect for its characters than even the comics did.So what's the strong point? Those freaking visuals again! The movie, as most of the MCU, is GORGEOUS. I foresee most Oscars going to the visual department, and I hope it wins at Best Costume Design. As i said, this movie is a love song and it shows in all the little details that make part of the Wakandan setting. Busan and London don't look scrappy either, and Oakland (from where the director hails) is dignified by it.It's kinda sad the strongest political message came, again as in many movies, from the villain. I suppose many who wanted to politicize (pro or against) this film were expecting &quot;dem truths&quot; dropped like mics, but it's usually the unfettered, the &quot;evil&quot; who says those words and this film didn't disappoint in that aspect. Sooo... does that mean they're &quot;evil&quot; statements? Does it take to be amoral to say what the african-american people want to say?As good the actors were, the main characters were a little bland except for the scene stealer MAH MAN M'BAKU. He was both strong and hilarious. There was so much that could've be done with Forrest Whitaker but hasn't, because all the young actors carried the movie in their shoulders and among them Winston Duke was the MVP. I somehow wish he was king but at least he got a much better limelight than in the comics.</review-text>

		<review-text>What is with all the hate for this movie from people who haven't even seen it yet? BLACK PANTHER IS OUTSTANDING!!! This movie is not unique because it's a movie about the first Black superhero ever created, or anything else of racial matters. Rather, tt has qualities that surpass many other Marvel or superhero films and makes a really compelling story with some outstanding qualities in terms of its characters, dialogue, tension, set design, and action .
Perhaps the most outstanding aspect that Black Panther has to offer is it's use and development of characters, and the well written dialogue. Like most other Marvel movies, it has some pretty funny lines, but many of the scenes and dialogue are serious and the tension you feel while watching it is great, even if there's no action going on, because the actors are doing a great job. And every single character is likable and useful to the story and none of them are pointless nor useless (*cough cough*Last Jedi). You really care about all these characters no matter what their ideals or motivations are, and they all fit perfectly in the story with their own set of unique purposes. And this goes especially for the main villain , Killmonger, who has very clear motivations and are developed and told in the story in brilliant fashion. You feel for and understand his struggles and is a much more important and outstanding villain than pretty much any other Marvel villain, who are mostly just disposable and forgettable. My personal favorite is Shuri because she's a very likable character being T'Challa's younger sister with her witty comments and you know how much she loves her brother when she helps him with her technological knowledge and assistance as he goes through his struggles and challenges to become the new King of Wakanda. 
Another aspect of the film that is also outstanding is the action sequences and set design . The set design and color palette are much more improved nd defined than a loth of other Marvel films, and there much to appreciate about the set up of Wakanda and it really feels like it actually exists in the real world. Sure, some of the green screen effects/CGI are kind of noticeable but for me that doesn't really doesn't distract me from how much amazing tension there is in the action sequences. Every fight/battle (especially in the climax) are thrilling and are done so well that it pulls you in to it's majesty. I felt some shivers and shakiness from these action sequences because they are brilliantly directed. 
And one last outstanding topic to cover: this movie does well on it's own and it not forgettable. Sure, it's the movie right before Infinity War and could've been just a set up movie for that .but no, it really stands out as it's own story, and with little to no ties to other Marvel movies and does not waste time setting up Infinity War or anything like that. In fact, you don't really need to watch any other marvel movies prior to this one because Black Panther works on its own as a great, almost game changing experience. Even though it's not perfect and it does kinda feel bland a little bit in the first act, it goes above and beyond towards the second and third act with all of it's action, tension, character development, and dialogue to make probably the most thoughtful and well-written/directed Marvel movies to date. Props to Ryan Coogler, the screenwriters, and all the actors who made Black Panther happen. Wakanda Forever!!!</review-text>

		<review-text>I've seen the movie twice since the February 15th preview, and I most likely will see it a third time before the end of the week. An African-American man, I loved that &quot;Black Panther&quot; feature strong, intelligent Black women. I love the action sequences and the well-placed humor. I especially love the director's celebration of African culture and language. Having seen the other movies in the Marvel movie franchise, I think &quot;Black Panther&quot; is a very welcome and much needed addition.</review-text>

		<review-text>Ryan Coogler uses the template of Black Panther being this African superhero leading a secret futuristic nation to bring something new, fun and important to not just watch but also listen to. While it is not new that superhero movies like the X-men films, The Dark Knight and more recently with Winter Soldier and Civil War have used the genre to comment on politics, Coogler goes straight into the subject matter of an issue that is more relevant then ever. From the imaginary of Africans being forced onto slave ships in the opening cinematic, Coogler is not sugar-coating the fact that Black Panther is addressing the sour history of white colonialism to the struggle of black communities in third-world nations and America today.On a visual and technical level it stands out from how many previous MCU films look and feel thanks to Coogler bringing his own cinematographer and composers he has collaborated with. Recently Oscar-nominated cinematography Rachel Morrison of Mudbound shoots very awe-moments that make Wakanda feel alive as a character. The music by Ludwig Gorisssons is also an improvement from the bland, predictable operatic score in past MCU films. The use of African chorus and instruments give Black Panther a lively feel with Gorissons using elements from Coogler's last movie Creed to give a sense of epic triumph. The action ranges from having the raw intensity in the Creed boxing matches to being kinetic and stylish, particular in the Korea scenes, like the Matrix. With the Vibranium technology Coogler finds a visual aesthetic to show Wakanda not looking too fantastical nor alien but more advanced then Tony Stark's tech while still retaining its African roots. Through that he brings of a vision of afrofuturism (a term I recently learned before this movie came out) to life where we see a culture of Africa that thrives as an advanced utopia without the influence of western whitewashing. But because some of Wakanda's ideals and beliefs may be questionable, it introduces fully fleshed-out characters that each bring a layer to Wakanda's culture. With old-fashioned traditionalist like T'Challa, Okoye, Zuri and M'Baku we see where there dedication to an ancient tradition of isolation and monarchy comes from but there views are clashed with those who think Wakanda could improve itself and the rest of the world from the country's own millennial generation in Shuri, the spy who has seen the outside world's problems in Nakia to the destructive revolutionist in Erik Kilmonger. 
Chadwick Boseman brings back his calm, cool charisma from Civil War but with a emotional conflict brewing inside him of how to approach his reign as king when new information is revealed about his heritage. Rather then sidelined as supporting roles, we see actresses like Lupita N'yongo, Danai Guirra and breakout Leticia Wright become co-leads of there own. Wright as T'Challa's sister Shuri brings so much levity to what can be considered a serious political story but never feels like she is just a comic relief as she also acts as a younger but even smarter version of Tony Stark. And Danai Guirra also becomes a standout in showing some intense dramatic moments when her duty as the King's royal bodyguard is questioned. Winston Dukes as M'Baku, the tribal leader and rival of T'Challa is another surprise standout that shows a lot more depth and humour then I was expecting.And at long last Marvel brings a villain that surpasses Loki on a psychologically layered and threatening level in Erik Kilmonger. Rather then just Kilmonger acting as plot device to force T'Challa on the hero's path like past MCU villains have done, he is presented with an arc that echoes the hero's own journey. The difference however is his own actions become very destructive that are fuelled by a personal tragedy. From the injustice people of African descent have suffered to Wakanda turning its back on those that need it like so many first-world nations have done, Kilmonger makes T'Challa truly ask as both a hero and king what kind of responsibility does someone with great power truly have. Michael B. Jordan's charming personality makes his villain very likeable but also channels a rebellious attitude and rage that puts past villains to shame. Andy Serkis also get some really fun and compelling moments as returning villain Klaw who is shown as an example of why Wakanda fear outsiders they call &quot;colonizers&quot;.The movie does have some problems though. While Martin Freeman gets more to do as Everett Ross then he did in Civil War, it does feel his role felt obligatory yet didn't feel like his character fit into the Wakanda storyline. The third act does fall into some of Marvel's usual final battle tropes with over-reliance on cg and the hero fighting an evil doppelgänger. But once the typical big battle ends, you see the hero and villain have a compelling conversation with who each other about their quest to accomplish the same goal.The best parts of this movie shine when Ryan Coogler as a director and co-writer takes control of the Marvel formula and uses it create an amazing and compelling standalone story that can leave with you with so much to talk about.</review-text>

		<review-text>This movie is not a Marvel movie. If you think it's going to be like others, you are wrong. I don't think it rightly compares to Marvel's typical fare. I love the MCU, but this movie is in a category of It's own. I think that is why people are giving it low review numbers. (Plus, i've heard some people are intentionally trashing it, which is very sad.) The movie is beautiful visually. From the set, to the costumes. The CGI could be better in the fight scenes where he is Black Panther, but this is why I took away a star. Yet the story is what makes this more than a typical Marvel Superhero movie. It is a story about old traditions and new. The acting is superb!!! I've seen complaints and I am completely baffled by it. Angela is wonderful, I felt Chadwick's pain at Forrest's death, I understood Michael's hurt over being left alone. This is a drama movie with Action to support it, not the other way around. For that reason, It's not a Marvel movie in my eyes. It's more and phenomenal!! I saw it on Friday opening weekend and will take my Mom next weekend.</review-text>

		<review-text>For anyone wondering about the disparity between the 100% positive critics reviews on RottenTomatoes and the not quite as universally high ratings here do yourself and Google &quot;Anti Black Panther Campaign&quot;. Putting aside all that nonsense Black Panther is simply a FANTASTIC piece of entertainment from start to finish.I've seen every single MCU film to date and this one stands with the very very best of them. For a while now the MCU films have been starting to get into a bit of a formulaic rut. At worst they're always at least entertaining but Black Panther is a true return to form with exactly the right mix of humor, action, drama, style and sheer wow factor. Do not let anyone convince you that the film is preachy or over the top with political soapboxing. That's simply not the case. The themes explored here are UNIVERSAL and could have been applied to virtually any culture, while at the same time the incredible costuming, soundtrack, and art direction tapped deeply into dozens of African cultures to create a visual and stylistic tapestry that was simply breathtaking.Even if that holds no appeal whatsoever, taken simply as a work of pure action entertainment the movie delivers by every measure. Action was fantastic, fight choreography the best since Netflix's Daredevil, and a stronger narrative arc than any MCU movie to date. The storytelling was simply superb with a clear beginning, middle, and end and rock solid character development. The writer did not fall into the recent pitfall of other MCU films of spinning out too many sub-plots or characters and instead masterfully focused on the core story at hand. As such this may well be the best stand alone MCU film since we were first introduced to Tony Stark in Iron Man, while still fitting perfectly into the larger MCU pantheon.Believe the hype.</review-text>
		<review-title>Easily the best MCU since the original Iron Man and the first Avengers film!</review-title>

		<review-text>Every time I think Marvel has produced a great movie the studio outdoes itself. With its latest release, 'Black Panther', it reaches unimaginable heights. I felt extremely proud watching this movie. It changes the conversation and gives us a new hero, a relatable hero. Heroes aren't defined by a certain race or culture and Black Panther embraces its roots while telling a captivating story. Exhilarating, emotional, and impactful- this one is a game changer.We were introduced to T'Challa, Black Panther, in 'Captain America: Civil War' a couple of years ago. His strength and conviction stood out then and I looked forward to seeing his story. After his father's untimely demise T'Challa takes the throne of Wakanda, a mysterious and isolated country in Africa that is years ahead of the rest of the world. Black Panther works as an origin story, a thriller, a social narrative, and a family saga all rolled into one. There's immense depth and a strong voice leading the film. The action is sharp and eye popping. There's grit and wit in equal measure and it doesn't shy away from hurtful truths. It's exactly what you want from a superhero movie and so much more.Director Ryan Coogler has shown Wakanda and its people with tremendous admiration. The characters are fully fleshed out and unapologetically black. Their pride is envy worthy. It's deeply gratifying to be able to identify with a character on screen. But an entire nation? It was unheard of before this film. The backbone of the movie, a compelling screenplay, plays out wonderfully on screen and is both moving and amusing. There's never a dull moment with these characters. And what beautiful characters!Chadwick Boseman leads the pack with his terrific portrayal of T'Challa- a man overcoming obstacles, a king trying to find his way, and a hero who has barely scratched the surface. The supporting cast is equally brilliant. Michael B. Jordan brings the right amount of menace and angst to his character creating a villain you want to root for. Another highlight of the movie, or I should say its strongest attribute, is the powerful women. Warriors, intellectuals, leaders, and spies. Each one stronger than the king, each one deserving of her own movie. Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and Letitia Wright are perfect. I am in awe.Representation matters. We hear it, we say it, and now we see it in action. Never again will a person of color have to wonder what it would be like to look like their heroes. As an avid movie watcher I'm filled with joy. Black Panther is an experience to be treasured. This panther comes at you claws out and rearing to go. Wakanda forever!

		<review-text>I was pleasantly surprised at how well the back story was for the various characters. So many times the movie just dives right in and your lost as to who the people are. Overall there was a back end to the main characters and the roles were true to who the characters were written to be. I thought the movie was very well done, it was a little slow at some points but the high points were super high. Even the slow parts had a lot of story to them so it wasn't boring. I feel it is important to build up the story line so I loved every minute of it.I liked that it stayed true to character. My husband had read most of the big comic series and I am a Marvel fan no doubt. Unlike the latest Thor Ragnarok which turned Thor into a comedian and was out of character... ... Black Panther stuck with the original story. And I LOVE THOR but was disappointed.... Anyway... About Black Panther...I think this movie is definitely a must see. I know true Super hero fans will love it and it is good for the whole family, which in my opinion a super hero film should be. Great action scenes, creative story, excellent acting, fantastic costumes and the technology was outrageous. I think that was a breathe of fresh air. Not the same old story again and again.Not to mention I enjoyed not getting cussed at every 5 minutes. The characters held their power and their parts very well. Bravo Marvel! Well done! Going again soon.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is Not Just Another Superhero Flick with the Typical Marvel Formula for its other Solo Movies, Directed By the Amazing Ryan Coogler Who is Known for his Critically Acclaimed Movies &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; And &quot;Creed.
The Movie Takes place 1 Week After the Events of Civil War,Where T'Challa is mourning his father's death as he takes his rightful place as king of Wakanda, a fictional African nation &quot;hiding in plain sight&quot;. But Things Shake Up When Movie's Main Erik Killmonger Played By Michael B. Jordan Comes into the Narrative Which Slowly Becomes one of the Best things about the Movie. Erik Killmonger's Motivation And intentions is Much More Deep And Complex Than showed in the trailer. One Of The Best Things About This Movie is how Every character from T'Challa , Killmonger to Other Supporting Characters is Really Well Written.
Coogler Doesn't Shy Away away from Breaking the Normal Superhero Theme Mould And Takes the writing into an Interesting Direction And Wins Another Gold For Marvel, Also the Movie Has Stunning Visuals And Badass Action Sequences.
Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa Or Black Panther is amazing in his Role And His Chemistry With Letitia Wright Who plays his Sister Shuri is a Delight to Watch. Other Actors Like Andy Serkis (Ulysses Klaue), Angela Bassett,Lupita Nyong'o,Danai Gurira,Daniel Kaluuya,Martin Freeman,Florence Kasumba Does Jobs but it's Michael B. Jordan Who Steals The Show With his Portrayal Of Erik Killmonger.
A Special Mention to Kendrick Lamar For His Great Soundtrack Which Lights up Every Single Scene Whenever it plays on the Screen.</review-text>

		<review-text>I was disappointed especially after all the positive reviews. What is with critics?? I am noticing that they give all blockbusters 10/10s and the like!!Next to the very stupid and boring new 'Star Wars' this is the worst though. The film is quite boring to start and wastes the potential to educate or entertain. Especially with its African setting it could have taught the audience a thing or two. Instead, we learn nothing, the fights are stupid and weak, there s little action overall and only the last 15 minutes are watchable. It is not worth $15 for the last 15 minutes in my opinion however. I did like the music however. So 4/10.I am still scratching my head at all the awful films the critics keep giving thumbs up to. Think this boring and underdeveloped film, think the last two so-called Star Wars, think Blade Runner 2049. There are still good films out there (The Gifted, Get Out, Captain Fantastic), but the hype goes to the wrong movies.
Perhaps it is time for Marvel and Disney to retire. Who knows?</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Excellence Personified! This is the truest and most authentic representation of Black people on screen I've ever seen. Ryan Coogler and the cast do a phenomenal job of capturing the uniqueness of African culture in both dress as well as values. The colorful wardrobes were awesome and majestic...especially during the tribal challenge at the waterfall. The technology? OFF THE CHAIN!! The dynamics of the relationships was riveting as well. Again, I can't say enough about this movie. I am eagerly awaiting the next installment!</review-text>
		<review-title>Black Panther ETHERED all the other MUC movies!</review-title>
	</review>
	<review id="546">
		<review-text>Let me start off and say that this film is aesthetically pleasing. The visuals of 
Wakanda are amazing, along with the the costume designs and cinematography. For the most part, the CGI was decent, but in some parts it looked very fake. At times you could tell that the characters were in front of a green screen. 
Now onto the acting, I have to say that all the actors and actresses did a fantastic job. Chadwick Boseman nailed it as the king of Wakanda, along with his friends. All the characters were diverse and unique. Shuri, played by Letitia Wright, was probably my favorite character in the movie, as she ailed it as a smart teenager. 
The villains of the movie, Kilmonger and Ulysses Klaue, were fantastic as well. I felt that they shouldn't have killed off Klaue, as his performance was amazing and it would've been cool to see him in other MCU films. Kilmonger was good too, but I felt that he was trying to act &quot;too tough&quot; at times, when he was already intimidating.
Now let me say that they did an excellent job on depicting the Wakandan culture. This seperates this movie from many other MCU films and makes it unique. 
Now I must talk about the &quot;BAD THINGS&quot;.
The pacing was off. It started out action packed and then it was slow, then it was action packed again-The CGI and green screen were very noticeable at times and in some scenes the CGI looks unfinished, like in the last fight between Kilmonger and T'challa. They looked like clay in that sceneSHOULD YOU WATCH IT?
Overall, Black Panther was a decent MCU film. It could've been better with a few tweaks and changes, but it was still fun to watch. You should go watch it. as it is very entertaining. If I were to rank this in a list of TOP 10 Marvel movies, I would put this one as the 7th. NOW GO BUY YOUR TICKETS!!!!</review-text>

		<review-text>I came into the theater with high expectations for Black Panther, given it was directed by one of my favorite young and rising directors, Ryan Coogler. Coogler, who previously directed Fruitvale Station and Creed, has proven to be an excellent director for portraying drama and character studies in contemporary settings. With Black Panther, though I had high expectations, I also didn't know what to expect; was Coogler going to do a drama or was he going to stray from his style to fit Marvel Studios' aesthetic?The answer is both, and the result is a unique film that at times feels like a Coogler film and, at other times, feels like a Marvel Studios fantasy.I overall enjoyed Black Panther; it fell short on some aspects in terms of being both a superhero film and a sociopolitical drama, but still manages to hit all the marks.The characters are well-written and lovable, simple as that. A superhero film is only as good as its villain, and Michael B. Jordan's portrayal of Killmonger is sure to be in the books as one of the stronger Marvel villains in the MCU. The film invests its story into fleshing out the emotional drama and perspective that Killmonger uses to justify his antagonistic actions; for the first time in a long time in the MCU, we sympathize with the &quot;villain,&quot; and his viewpoints touches on the social commentary in which the film finds its strengths. Letitia Wright as Shuri also stole the show, both serving as tasteful comedy relief and as a strong supporting character to Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa.The social commentary of this film, which is what I was most looking forward to, is excellent. It's not very explicit and takes some thinking to dissect, and frankly I could spend hours analyzing the metaphors this film produces that connect the fantastic themes present in Wakanda to our real-world issues of marginalization and how the world perceives Third World Countries. Instead, I will say that the social commentary is used as a means to advance the film's plot and retain the central themes; it's like any good Marvel movie that poses a moral question (Winter Soldier, Civil War), only this time it feels more contemporary and more relevant than ever. The themes touch on the power of countries and what responsibility they bear to the world, and particularly focuses on the marginalization and historical oppression of African Americans and poses the question on what can be done to resolve this continuous issue in our society. It's very compelling and is a story that must be told, making Black Panther an excellent addition to Ryan Coogler's dramatic filmography.That said, this film does try to balance between being a dramatic social discussion and a fantastic superhero film, and ultimately that becomes the reason why this film fell flat on certain moments. The action is derivative, CGI-laden, and boring, and this was disappointing given that Creed had simply phenomenal fight sequences and choreography. I will say that the action in Black Panther has the same emotional background and payoff that the fighting in Creed had, but Coogler is still trying to find his footing on how to direct a superhero action sequence, and I think he tried a bit too hard on appealing to comic book fans on this one when it came to the action (too many cutaways, not enough careful focus or emphasis on skilled combat, etc.). There were definitely some action moments I loved (at one point we had a one-shot moment again a la Creed), but there wasn't enough. The film is also grounded in fantasy; few scenes take place in contemporary cities, which I was hoping for more of, but, ultimately, that's personal preference. Wakanda's scenes feel somewhat like the scenes of Asgard in the Thor franchise, so the fantasy aspects can be a bit tiring. To each their own.Overall, Black Panther is definitely the best Marvel film in a while (since, arguably, Captain America: The Winter Soldier) but is certainly not the best. Although riddled with superhero cliches and dialogue, Black Panther's compelling social commentary, strong characters, and an all-around excellent cast make it an excellent addition to both Coogler's filmography as well as the MCU.</review-text>

		<review-text>I got a ticket to an advanced screening tonight. I watch all the superhero movies and usually they are predictable to me, however Black Panther had &quot;several&quot; plot twists that I didn't see coming. Graphics were excellent! Can't say I really noticed the music. Also some good Laugh Out Loud moments-phrases-jokes. I would give this a solid 9 out of 10. Very happy I will be seeing it twice more between now and Sunday</review-text>

		<review-text>This movie left me in awe because the way the role of each character illustrated how powerful black people are especially when we come together as well. Wakanda, a beautiful and exquisite country, led by 5 clans was more technologically advanced than any other country and giving Africa the reputation of being supreme and powerful technologically was bold and called for. Currently, this is not the case but Africa deserves to be since the beginning of life started from the motherland. 
In addition, I am really thankful and grateful for the fact that the black females in this movie played a HUGE role in the saving of Wakanda and the women were very assertive and definitely had power of the men in some ways. The females in this movie were intelligent and extremely courageous and definitely had tremendous loyalty with Wakanda. This was a great all around movie with great action and story line as well.</review-text>

		<review-text>I think black panther is above your average marvel movie. In a sense it exemplifies the cultural existence and relevance of the African culture that hasn't been seen in marvel's previous movies. It feels good to see people of color actually being successful and motivated by honor. Black Panther not only was a hero,but he also helped out his community while staying true to his heritage. Kill-monger was raised without a father, in a sense he had an American way of living that was very similar to the selfishness and self centered american President that we have today. If you are racist at all, you will not like this movie. Why? because the cultural symbolism of the African culture constantly thrives on the Black race being the Superior being in this movie. From the technology to the clothes and style. Black Panther not only symbolizes just a super hero movie, but a culture that was once driven by black heritage but settlers took that land and until now it was forgotten. This movie will be historic, showing the power and strength of Black women. Although Black Panther was gone, his girlfriend stood by his side and saved him from death. The resemblance of stubbornness and strength in a very loyal Black woman. Black love that is. Black women thrived in this movie, being the body guards and fully trusted souls that Black Panther believed in. That not only created the technology for him, but they protected him. Something that will always be remembered in a time where our President shake's his head at third world countries :D.</review-text>

Go and watch it. Don't expect to see a masterpiece, as this is a damn superhero movie. Take it as it is. It makes sense, it fits in the universe and is really enjoyable.

		<review-text>In my opinion, Black Panther tells one of the more interesting stories on the MCU, featuring a cast of brilliant actors who bring Wakanda to life. Notice, how i coined Wakanda rather than Black Panther specifically, this is due to the fact that Wakanda was o much of a character in the film and so many of its culture, natural beauty and citizens were fleshed out and made a large part of this film. In fact a lot of time and dedication were gone into the other aspects of the film. I thought that the film had one of MCU's more interesting villains as well, in the form of Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger, quite a lot is gone into his back story and as a street level villain I think he worked quite well. Much like the use of Vulture in Spider-man Homecoming. But, while in that case, the villain is menacing within a smaller 'street level' situation I thought in this case it's not necessarily Killmonger himself but what he represents that makes him the compelling villain that he is. Granted, he had a significant motive that can be empathized with he had a significant tie as to what he represented, the flaws in the former king T'Chaka and the conflicts that is bound to burden our hero T'Challa, the struggles he must make to choose between the right path and the path that would best benefit his people. I also enjoyed the many characters from Wakanda, Danai Gurira's Okoye was a strong female character that was a badass. Letitia Wright's Shuri who was a fun and interesting character as well. There was a decent amount of comedy that does not come into the expense of drama that the previous Thor Ragnarok may sometimes be criticized for and on a whole was a thrilling ride.All of which set in a setting that is stunning to look it, te blend of modern skyscrapers and vast mountains/valleys. And, the Wakandan culture, the rituals, the tribes, the vibrant colours all of which were presented in such a way that engages audiences and makes them grow more curious as to the many other facets of the fictional culture.</review-text>

		<review-text>SPOILERS BELOW!Very few movies give me the thrill of discovery. Fewer still give me a sense of wonder or touch my heart. Black Panther ticked all my boxes. I throughly enjoyed this movie. True, there was a lot of hype going in. Marvel worked the numbers and made sure every person on earth with an Internet connection had access to snippets of the movie and trailers were released to keep the momentum going. I feared that this over exposure would work to the film's detriment. When the release date was announced, I thought, &quot;cute. release it during Black History Month. heavy handed much?&quot; I went in prepared to be disappointed. I was NOT disappointed. The level of excitement within the Black community where I live was high. Sure, we had Blade but that was over ten years ago. There was Spawn but, no reflection on Michael Jai White, who wants to identify with demon reject from Hell? I mean, really?? Other superheros of color? Don't think so. Sure, sidekick roles aplenty but nothing uniquely ours. I got to the theater in Vicksburg, Mississippi and was surprised at the lines waiting to get tickets. I bought my ticket on-line in anticipation of this very thing but the number of people waiting was more than I thought would be in attendance. Oh, and some people came dressed in their best Afrocentric garb. How cool was that?Black Panther is more than a superhero origin flick. It is a genre bashing tour-de-force. It is indeed an origin story but it also includes some spy elements. There's some royal family hijinks and socio-political commentary. None of it is too heavy handed to get in the way of a rollicking good time.a Chadwick Boseman is on point as the titular character. We find him just as he is taking on the mantle of King of Wakanda and Protector The Black Panther. He survives a challenge by one of the leaders of a border tribe. But doesn't have time to settle into his role before he is challenged, again, by the long lost son of his uncle. A cousin he never knew he had. So the sins of the father are now visited upon the son. Michael B. Jordan wears the role of villain well. His Killmonger is filled with a justifiable rage. He challenges and 'kills' T'Challa' to secure the throne of Wakanda and the title of Black Panther. That's when his vision for Wakanda takes a turn for the worse. The supporting male actors led by Forest Whittaker are fully formed individuals with their own stories that weave into the tapestry that is Wakanda.My favorite characters were the Dora Milaje. These fierce warriors are the body guards of the king. These characters were not based on myth. They actually have historic counterparts. The Mino were the all female regiment in what is not Benin. Westerners called them the Dahomey Amazons. And that's the other thing that the movie does. It gives us...all of us of African descent...something to be proud of besides animated lions and CGI gorillas. It allows us to be proud of the diversity of the Mother Continent without pandering or caricatures. This is not Congo, or Tarzan. The Africans are not bumbling sidekicks. They are front and center and they kick ass! The Dora Milaje have a vital part to play in the movie. They are not arm candy and need no one to rescue them. They are led by General Okoye portrayed by The Walking Dead's Dania Gurira. The Dora Milaje were introduced in Captain America: Civil War. Actress Florence Kasumba's one line (Move or you will be moved.) spoken with quiet authority piqued my interest. T'Challa's sister, Shuri, is a tech genius. She creates all his suits, weapons, gadgets and other items using the mineral vibranium that is only found in Wakanda. Angela Bassett is the queen mother.The action sequences are astounding. Ryan Coogler knows how to shoot action to keep you on the edge of your seat. The casino fight was awesome. Two women fought numerous assailants. It's the first time I've seen a wig used as a weapon. Although, to be fair, Okoye was tired of it before the butt kicking started.Black Panther has it all. There's humor, heartache, pathos, action, action, cool tech, warmth...something for everyone. Do yourself a favor and go see it on the big screen. You will not regret it. I'm going back to get another dose of all that Wakandan goodness. Join me.</review-text>
		<review-title>Black Panther Lives Up To The Hype</review-title>
	</review>
	<review id="556">
		<review-text>Black Panther in my opinion, is the most unique and different Marvel movie made so far. Many Marvel movies are copy and pastes of each other, and yes this movie does have some elements that were copied from other Marvel movies, but Black Panther made it its own thing. This movie has unique characters and a unique setting. Black Panther does have some issues though, like the overkill comedy and the iffy CGI. Although there are few issues with the movie, all of the issues are very noticeable and are not easy to ignore. Some scenes the CGI was very noticeable. There was just too much CGI used, I would like a little more practical effects. The comedy was just too much, I don't want Marvel to keep putting this type of comedy in their movies. A little comedy is good, but too much can ruin a movie.Story: 9/10There was only one problem with the story, but everything else was on point. The climax was weak in my opinion. There was so much hype in the movie for the climax, but the climax was disappointing. When the climax happened, the CGI was very noticeable and looked fake at times, and when T'Challa and Killmonger fought, all I saw was CGI. There was no pacing issues, which was shocking, because the movie is over 2 hours long. There was some bits that made me yawn, but the movie quickly got to the action before it got a little too boring. Wakanda is the setting of the movie, and I'm happy the way it turned out. Wakanda has a very futuristic style, which makes it a good and unique setting. I like what's at risk in the movie. Some movies give that &quot;Save the world, it depends on you&quot;, but this movie doesn't fall for that. If T'Challa doesn't stop Killmonger, then the world could be at risk, due to the rare ore Wakanda has that can change the world, because of how powerful it is. Killmonger's plan is to share the ore and basically expose Wakanda, which could lead to a giant war that can end humanity on Earth. Overall, the story is strong, with real stakes at risk and great pacing, but a horrible climax.Characters: 10/10The antagonist, Killmonger is a very strong character. Killmonger has realistic and emotional motives, which really isn't evil motives, but at the same time, it could end the world. Many villains in movies are bad guys because they're evil, but the villain Killmonger doesn't have that common issue. T'Challa is another good character. He's a diverse character, not only suffering from Killmonger, but the guilt of his father's death. The supporting cast is well done. Each actor/actress did a great job on their character. The acting was also great, Michael B. Jordan stole the show for me, even though he was barely in the movie. Michael B. Jordan made his character (Killmonger) a believable antagonist, by showing a dark and a light side of Killmonger, which in my opinion makes a good villain. Overall, all the characters had their own role in the movie. The protagonist and the antagonist have their own inner conflict, which makes them diverse characters.Action: 7/10The action was the weakest part of Black Panther. Both the CGI and comedy affected the movie negatively. The CGI was iffy at some parts, for example the climax. The climax was a mess, in my opinion. The CGI wasn't bad, but from a Marvel movie, I expected more. The comedy was just overkill to me, although some parts were funny and made me laugh, but it's just too much. I think Marvel is too focused on comedy at the moment. The visual effects were really well done though. I liked the visuals and the colors used. Black Panther is on the same level as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which is a high level to set. Overall, Black Panther had a variety of colors and visuals that made Black Panther look amazing, but in some instances, the CGI looks very bad for a Marvel movie, and the comedy was just a little too much.Black Panther was overall a good movie. There was some issues that really lowered the score for me, but with great directing and awesome action scenes, like at the beginning. This movie does everything right, to the characters and to the story. If Black Panther had a little more time to fix things up and look at the script, then Black Panther could've got a 10/10 from me. Black Panther earns it's place as a good Marvel movie. I recommend Black Panther to everyone who hasn't seen it yet. If you're looking for a good movie to watch, then Black Panther would be a good option.</review-text>

		<review-text>Not sure what all the hate is for on this movie, but I enjoyed it. Is it the best Marvel movie of all time? Not at all, but it was a different kind of Marvel movie that was interesting in it's own way. Yeah it was a little bit too predictable at times and that is the only reason why it is getting an 8 star rating. When the first Guardians of the Galaxy came out a bunch of people thought it would flop, and it ended up being one of the best Marvel films of all time, and that's what viewers should think the same because it was a quite delightful film. Good story, memorable characters and stunning visuals. Plus a lot of these reviews say that it's political and that is a huge negative, there is nothing political about it. Makes me kind of think some people used multiple or rogue accounts to leave bad reviews. Go see this film!</review-text>

		<review-text>One of the movies we most hoped for and was worth the hype all over.
For a source film I want to highlight the various action scenes and the characters behind this great movie.
Spectacular action scenes, surrounded by a fantastic soundtrack, made by Kendrick Lamar.
The mood is well placed and only used in the most appropriate parts.
Unlike the other Marvel movies, the characters demonstrate a certain charisma, in the case of Martin Freeman, who does a good job. The main character is still learning about everything and this is notorious throughout the film, something that is transmitted to the viewer. The villain is represented with a particular motivation, which causes the spectator to divide in certain parts, doubting if he should support the hero or the villain. But, the best of the film, are the women, the protectors of Wakanda and the king's family.
In short, Marvel was right in another movie that will belong to my top 3.I was not surprised that this movie could be nominated for one or more Oscars, one of better characterization and the other of better photography.WAKANDAFOREVER!!</review-text>

		<review-text>This film tells the story of a super human who helps the prince of an African nation to succeed in the throne, and helps to prevent a war from breaking out.It's refreshing to have an African superhero, and even more refreshing to have a film that incorporates a lot of African cultural and ethnic elements. I looked the scene where people in various running costumes gather sound a waterfall. That was spectacular. The story itself is very engaging, and it's great to see both traditional and superhero style fights in ample quantities. The cities are very stylish as well. It is a great blend of enough elements and futuristic elements. There are also plenty of rises and falls in the plot to engage the viewers. The visuals are great as well. I really enjoyed it.</review-text>

		<review-text>This is a great origin story. I have no idea who The Black Panther is or where he came from but left the film knowing all I needed to know. I thought the acting was good - with guards and royalty rightly subdued. Some complaints have said they're acting &quot;wooden&quot; but - no - they're acting with decorum. You wouldn't have a King act like, for example, Deadpool. The characters were mostly well-thought out with the exception of Killmonger whom I found a little lacking. He was enjoyable enough but - one minute he isn't there, then he is and this is his story thrown in quick. Okay then... It didn't ruin my enjoyment of the film but given the length (over 2 hours), perhaps they could have trimmed elsewhere to show more of him too? The start of the film was a little muddled with the directing of the action sequence, which was a little hard to tell what was going on but thankfully it became better with later action sequences. As for action, there isn't a lot due to the story being told but what there was, was exciting enough even though - certain scenes - you knew how they would play out. For example, you know this person won't win this particular showdown because of whom they're up against, kind of thing.The humour in this film isn't as much as other films but, again, it fits the world the story is in. Stan Lee's cameo was nice ;) I do like the fact he pops up in all of the films! The scenery in the film was glorious, the CGI done properly (not like a certain DC film that came out recently). What I will say though, I went in thinking I would hate this film because the trailer just looked dull. I'm glad I went regardless. I'm not sure how they would do a good trailer for this without giving all of the action sequences away but... Yep... As far as Marvel Origin stories go, I believe this is one of the stronger despite a few niggles. I look forward to seeing more of Black Panther.</review-text>

		<review-text>This movie is nice, beautifully shot and thoroughly narrated. One cannot simply ignore the powerful messages about feminism, equality, and so on. There are no damsel in distress; women are finally doing important stuff in this movie instead of just sitting still looking pretty. The plots are standard, some cliches here and there, but it's okay for me. WHAT BOTHERS ME A LOT IS THE CAMERA MOVEMENT. I wanted to puke in both basketball field scenes, some action sequences gave me terrible headache. I don't know if the director did this on purpose, for artsy reason or whatever. So while this is a very colorful movie with strong messages (even the villain has a debatable moral value), I simply cannot give it a full standing ovation. I ran out of the theatre right after the credits rolled to get rid of the vertigo effect.</review-text>

		<review-text>Empowering, captivating, executed flawlessly. One must realize that this is a superhero movie. Designed to be enjoyed by 10-year-olds as well as adults. For an origin film, the movie brings you up to speed perfectly Chadwick Bozeman does a phenomenal job playing 'T'Challa'. MCU really has their films down to a science and adds onto the forumula they'vs built on franchises like Thor / Avengees etc. Also I would be very wary of any reviews prior to February 14. It may be fake news.  If you are on the fans definitely check it out will be disappointed</review-text>

		<review-text>I´m so happy that a super hero movie actually features heros with african descent. Pround and strong warriors who are standing there ground. It is very good to see Africans beeing more than slaves, criminals or what ever the white men prejudices about Afrcians are.The movie it self is fun to watch. Entertaining story and cgi, very good actors and good story telling.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is a visually delightful movie. The story is nicely told, if predictable (though the sub-plot about the American-born prince added an interesting layer). It's right out of the Marvel Universe formula, with a strong, flawed lead character, endearing supporting characters and obligatory villain bent on doing evil. My new favorite is the king's tech wizard sister Shuri. The costumes were wonderful and I like the way they interspersed actual African language (Xhosa) in the film. It is unusual to have a movie with many dark skinned black people playing positive roles, and this movie was ground breaking in that respect. Some of the CGI in the action scenes was over the top, though we've come to expect that in Marvel films.On the whole, Black Panther is a strong addition to the Marvel Universe. I look forward to seeing him and some of his Wakandans in upcoming films.</review-text>

		<review-text>Both the first dream of 2018 and the first film of Black Panther
Captain America set off 1.5 years ago: Black panther entered the war scene of heroes, the movie waited a long time, and I always wondered, and as I hoped it was a film I filmed, I saw that the acting scenes were wonderful and they prepared a cliché, of course only Americans could save the world. There was music based on the traditional music of old African countries that was good for the theme, and of course hiphop style music. Ultimately, Captain must take the place of his father who died in America, T'Challa, pass the ceremony and the king will be chosen and will try to protect this adventurous Wakanday; old girlfriend's brother, mother and Agent Rose are helping her. While trying to get Wakanday back, T'challa's cousin T'challa is trying to get her pound from Erik Killmonger.
The only goal of Erik Killmonger was not to capture Wakandai, but to seize the world with weapons made from Vibranium sources in Wakande and try to stop it.</review-text>

		<review-text>Marvel's latest entry in their ever-expanding cinematic universe follows directly after Captain America: Civil War, with Chadwick Boseman's Prince T'Challa, a.k.a., Black Panther, preparing to take the throne of Wakanda after his father's tragic death. Written and directed by Ryan Coogler (and Joe Robert Cole), who is on a real hot streak after Fruitvale Station and Creed, Black Panther is the first superhero/comic book movie to feature a black lead since the Blade series (1998, 2002 &amp; 2004), but more than that, this is a distinctively African story with a predominantly black cast. Something that's equally unique for a franchise film and a tentpole movie that's leading into Avengers: Infinity War. Whether Black Panther will prove to be significant enough to encourage more faith in diverse casts within the industry and audiences at large is yet to be seen, but I've every confidence that this will be a very popular and successful film. And it deserves to be. Black Panther is really terrific. Importantly, to some degree, Black Panther also works as a stand-alone film, being quite self-contained despite being part of a bigger world. Much like Wakanda, which is almost akin to an African Brigadoon; a place hidden in the jungle, unknown to outsiders, unseen, but magical within. This Utopia has been built on a rare metal that is more technologically advanced than anything else on earth, whilst a certain plant unique to the land is key to the royal bloodline and the power of Black Panther. This is a beautifully realised film, with a real cultural sensibility with a true identity established for Wakanda and its inhabitants. Every scene is brought vividly to life, from tribal rituals on the top of a waterfall to a city infrastructure, throne rooms and tech centres, and a nice diversion to Busan, where one of the film's villains, Andy Serkis' Klaue is being pursued. What's also evident is the enjoyment and commitment a truly excellent cast displays throughout. From Boseman, who plays T'Challa as an intelligent, sensitive, proud man, to a fierce Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyonga on assertive form, and a sparkling performance from Letitia Wright, who, is both T'Challa's sister and a Q-like master of arms and tech specialist. With palace intrigue abound, Black Panther finds ways to make T'Challa truly reflect his culture, which goes some way to counterbalance some of the typical - perhaps even expected - superhero movie tropes; absent fathers, flying machines, special costumes and a major battle at the climax. With the battle in question finding a different approach to the city under siege narrative that's been overdone in terms of mass destruction. There's strong support from Martin Freeman, Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya, and Angela Bassett. Distinctive costume design, great music and a fine score. Plus well-paced moments of humour in a film that's smart, self-aware, ambitious enough to be individual within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and a real pleasure from start to finish.</review-text>

		<review-text>I watched all the hype before the movie, and wasn't really sure what to expect from it. I thought i would go and see it just to support the cause. But the shock i got!! It was really good!!! They did justice to the characters. The acting was brilliant!!!! The fighting scene could have been better, but i dont even watch the fighting scene in movies, I typically just look at my phone till they are done. So i didn't mind. Will definitely see it twice! And if i'm being honest, I probably could connect to it so much because I am African.</review-text>

		<review-text>If anyone on here says that the movie is too politicized, then they are lying and have not watched the movie. Too many people are on here just to give the movie a bad rating because of the name of the film, the fact that is stars a predominant black cast and because they are extremely insecure. There are virtually no politics in the film, and it's just a very well acted, very well directed and awesome superhero film. You have two Academy award winners in this film, four of the actors have been nominated for an Oscar and two of them have an MFA from Yale. They are an insanely gifted cast and brilliant actors, and they did not disappoint here. It has beautiful scenery, a great storyline and high octane action sequences. A+</review-text>

		<review-text>'BLACK PANTHER': Five Stars (Out of Five)The eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, based on the Marvel Comics character Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman reprises the title role (who first appeared in 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR'), and the movie costars Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Andy Serkis, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker. It was directed by Ryan Coogler, who also helmed the critically acclaimed hits 'FRUITVALE STATION' and 'CREED' (which also both starred Jordan), and it was written by Coogler and Joe Robert Cole (based on characters created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby). The story revolves around the African superhero returning home to the nation of Wakanda, where he is now king, but his leadership is challenged by a new enemy. The film has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's being called (by some) a revolutionary cultural movement (in much the same way that 'WONDER WOMAN' was last year). It's also projected to break records at the Box Office, and become Marvel Cinema's biggest hit to date. I really enjoyed it as well. The story begins right after the end of 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR', with T'Challa (Boseman) returning home to the African nation of Wakanda. Since his father was killed, T'Challa is named the new king of Wakanda. At the same time a Wakandan exile, going by the name of Killmonger (Jordan), has aligned himself with a South African black-market arms dealer, named Ulysses Klaue (Serkis), and is plotting to overthrow T'Challa. T'Challa, as the superhero Black Panther, attempts to stop Klaue from stealing more vibranium (while unaware of Killmonger's involvement). Two female special forces agents (Nyong'o and Gurira), CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Freeman), and T'Challa's teenage sister Shuri (Wright), all end up aiding him on this mission.I have to agree that this is one of Marvel Cinema's best movies, and I think it's cultural significance (and popularity) is really inspiring too. While I don't think it's quite as good a film as 'WONDER WOMAN' is, it's still a masterpiece in it's own right. It's great that superhero movies (in general) are becoming such a respected, and revolutionary art form too. Haters will of course still hate the film (as they did 'WONDER WOMAN' as well, and anything that creates such powerful progress like this), but everyone else should definitely enjoy it (unless you just really hate superhero movies). The action scenes are spectacular, the performances are all good, the humor is clever and witty, and the dramatic scenes are moving (and briefly touching too). Coogler once again proves what a talented director he is, and he appears to be the perfect filmmaker for this important movie.</review-text>

		<review-text>This movie was a little bit different from the previous marvel films, though its not a bad film, they still managed to make it good. the visuals were great but in my opinion the story is just...meh. the villain was great and probably one of the best villains in the mcu, the performance is also great, character development is great but after that, it feels like just another normal superhero movie. but the film has its moments, there are a lot of scenes that are just really great, action sequences are well choreograph like the long one shot in the movie. but what's amazing in this movie is the visuals, the story may be not that good, but the characters and visuals and action sequences just make this movie not bad.overall it's an enjoyable movie</review-text>

		<review-text>My first entry in 2018, yeayyy.....!!! So here it goes....
When I watched it on the theater, I felt something not right about this movie. It almost didn't felt like, &quot;Marvelish&quot;, in fact, it almost didn't felt like any mainstream superhero movie I've encountered over the past two decades since I was born for it tells more about the people and the reality some of us face around the globe than the hero himself. The effect of colonialism, racism, slavery, hatred, and the supremacist movement was put inside the heart of one man who is most likely to be the hero than the main character himself (whose alter ego becomes the very titular of the movie) had 'Black Panther' written as a literary source from the 18th - 19th century where slavery was at its peak: Erik Kilmonger.So yeah, what I'm trying to say is: 'Black Panther' would turn out gloriously as a masterpiece had it been written as a book comparable to 'Sula', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Things Fall Apart', or any other works that focus on the mistreatments of the Blacks/Afro-Americans. But as a movie? Errrr... not so much. I mean it's generally good and I see why so many critics fall in love with it, but some elements ruin the elements and the messages that made 'Black Panther' more than a comicbook movie such as the cgi based one-on-one fight between T'Challa and Erik (in fact, many of the phenomenal Black Panther's moves and martial arts were done by computers). I'm fully aware of the reason why they had to cgi-ed BP's over-the-top jumps, upper cuts, punches, kicks, overhead kicks, and so on, but at least try to involve more humanly approach (like wires, stuntmen, etc) and a more smooth cgi for these scenes to make it more realistic and pleasing to the eye. Why didn't they just copy the treatment of 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016) for the fight scenes in this movie? Can't you see that the fight and chase scene between Bucky, BP, and Captain America was among the most jaw-dropping action scenes Marvel Studios has ever produced without so much waste of cgi? Honestly, I prefer the Batman raid scene in 'BvS' (considered by many as a ****** movie) than the duel match between BP and Erik in a movie that many people love so much. Not to mention that some of the scenes make the movie a little bit boring that some of us inside the theater either checked their phones and probably asking themselves when the movie might end.
Despite all of the downsides, this is probably the only movie that makes me interested in the richness African cultures with all the traditions, the dances, the songs, the warcry, the outfits, the earings, the histories, the tools, the masks, their way of life, their faiths, etc. Like it or not, we have no other choice than to admit that 'Black Panther' is one of the boldest movie Hollywood ever produce for it explore the black continent as it has never been done before by any other American movies before (though fictional one). It helps us to open our eyes of the beauty of the real-world Africa in the time where most of us are more fascinated by the work ethics and the cultures of the Japanese, the beauty of the South Korean boy/girl band members and actors/actresses, the economic prowess and the development of China, or the beautiful views of European famous big cities. The director (Ryan Coogler) has put so much effort in reminding us that this is a black people's movie, directed by black director, played by (mostly) black actors and actresses, about black superhero and the continent where he lives. You can easily find the director's intention from the African, 'Lion King-ish' backsongs on some of the scenes and the Afro-American rap style like the ones you can find in 'Fruitvale Station' or any other movies about black people. Ryan also didn't forget to put some Game-of-Thrones level of intrigue where the rightful king has to give up his rightful title and rightful throne to a stranger (who's actually the king's *SPOILER ALERT*) and the king's bodyguards (The Dora Milaje) have no option but to obey and protect their new king despite their resentment to him.Oh wait, have told you about another BP's villain, Ulysses Klaue? Played by the great and magnificent Andy Serkis, Klaue is, in my most humble opinion, a more suitable choice for the role of an antagonist than the tragic hero Erik Kilmonger thanks to these factors: he is lunatic, he's been running for more than 30 years from the clutch of the most advanced nation in the history of the world in MCU (since the time when T'Chaka, the father of T'Challa and the Black Panther before him, was on his peak), he is pure evil, fearless, and almost reminds you of Heath Ledger's Joker from Chris Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'.So far, 'Black Panther' is the movie we all have been waiting for (mostly by the people of color since they have so little amount of heroes/heroines that are worthy to represent them and they can look up to) since the hero's conception in the 60s, or perhaps, way long before that: since the golden age of Hollywood at the 30s in which American movies reached its peak of storytelling that focuses on its heroes/heroines/protagonists portrayed mostly (if not all) by white males/females. Not too great to me, but not bad either. It's good for a solo-debut movie, and it's the right move to pave a way for something much, much bigger yet to come to the MCU, something that is written and can be clearly seen by all the audiences who can patiently wait until the very end of the movie: Black Panther will return in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR</review-text>
		<review-title>When Marvel decided to make remake 'Lion King', 'Fruitvale Station', and 'Game of Thrones' into one movie, 'Black Panther' is all you got (Though it mostly 'Lion King').</review-title>

		<review-text>Wow. There's just not much to criticize here. I think the people who will be most disappointed are the people going in expecting a standard action-packed superhero movie where a costumed hero battles a costumed villain for the better part of two hours with a little dialog and drama interspersed so as not to get tedious and a forced and unnecessary romance subplot no one actually cares about. This is kind of the opposite.It's an almost Shakespearean drama with fresh takes on everything that has made this genre feel tiresome. Beautiful world-building, artistic vision, mind-blowing sets, elaborate and gorgeous costuming, a dozen brilliant acting performances, a nuanced villain with a grounded real-world perspective and motivation, an extended cast that actually matters, a historical background that provides context without the endless flashbacks and hamfisted exposition, and a real sense of danger and importance surrounding the events.There are a few predictable tropes that play out exactly as expected, but it's mostly fun and highly inventive in other areas. Killmonger is one of the MCU's best villains, and the final battle was like watching a Tron remix of a Capcom fighting game.</review-text>

	<review id="577">
		<review-text>It was a good film don't get me wrong but the main reason i didn't really like the film as much as everyone else is because i prefer killmongers character to t'challa. Having a villain like this is only good when you have an established superhero which you already feel emotions for. For example daredevil and the punisher. After watching daredevil season 1 you feel emotions towards daredevil making you always want to support him then with the introduction to the punisher and his origin it creates a choice for you to choose between daredevil and punisher in which morally you would end up supporting daredevil because of the heroism he has already shown. The tough choice you have to make adds some depth and emotional value to the show/film and makes the rest of the film/show more interesting. T'challa has not shown this heroism and sacrifice in the MCU yet. The only appearance was him trying to hunt down bucky for murdering his father. In civil war his role isnt very important and we do not get emotionally attached. t'challa seemed more interested in getting the girl than helping the outside world and takes him the whole movie to realise that he should help. That doesnt seem heroic to me. the origin of killmonger was far more touching and i felt his goals were justified. having your father killed by your own people while you are a child whilst your dad promised to take you back there must have been very hard and the amount of work he put into becoming king shows his motivation. Killmonger wasn't a villain by choice but was made one by the environment of which the wakandans left him in. Leaving him alone in the oppression that he faced was obviously not going to end well. t'challa's reaction to him coming to wakanda was not remorseful but was rude and didn't try to make up for his fathers mistake. it seems very hypocritical as he says something about not judging him on past kings but killmonger already put at a disadvantage due to his father. After beating t'challa, he in my eyes was the true king and for a place that goes on honour and ritual cheating to bring t'challa back by giving him the strength of the black panther doesn't seem right to me. You look at killmonger as a villain but he was only doing what our governments do everyday by giving and selling weapons to keep people oppressed. Meaning all the american superheroes you support are bad. All of this would be great for a sequel because we would have more of a connection to t'challa making us want him to win and question ourselves on the way. But i don't at this point and wasn't happy when t'challa prevailed i just felt disappointed. im not saying i agree with what killmonger was doing i just don't agree with t'challa either.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther serves justice. It has great villain, character development, deep story line. Some people are expecting more humor but for me it has just the right amount of humor. Ragnarok made itself a joke, Black Panther just gives enough kick for it to still be taken as a serious film. It digs deep into the culture and history, not just some shallow action scenes like other Marvel films. Best MCU movie to date. Go watch it.</review-text>

		<review-text>This movie is fantastic as a stand alone film and part of the MCU. ***There are a few spoilers ahead***I was worried given all the hype that this film would not deliver on the level of hype it was receiving, but it does. The action is fantastic, the characters are well developed and amazing. The real issues they bring up are amazing and it's only in small doses, so it does not alienate certain movie goers. It does give you a perspective from others point of views, and thought provoking. The conflict between what to do and what not to do(especially between the protagonist and antagonist) is what is most compelling to me. The action scenes are amazing (except for one), and the creative minds behind what technology can all be gained by vibranium is sensational. Like all movies, there are a couple flaws, it got a little slow and it is predictable. That is not the movies fault though as it is within this universe so it has restrictions on where they can take things within one installment. The CGI in the fight scene at the end between T'challa and Kilmonger was a little poor, but did not take away from the movie. All of the actors did a fantastic job, there wasn't one bad performance in the film. Overall 10/10!!!</review-text>

		<review-text>It's spoiler free. No Worries.I came here and read the movie reviews from other users before start writing my own. I think it's more of preference problem for people who rated the movie as bad, even under average. I personally loved this movie.Plot holes, sure there will always be plot holes in any movies. (Even in real life, the things that 'should go a certain way' can turn out to be the most nonsensical way though). Start with the cons, from my point of view, at some point the main conflict of the movie was pretty typical. The development pace of the movie can be a little inconsistent. Not to mention there are some CGI disappointment. Marvel-Disney production is usually one of the most decent in CGI that you sometimes can't even tell. But in this movie, in some scene the CGI are too obvious and even to the level of you think you're watching some early 2000s or even late 90s movies.Some fighting scene are just not to well shot. At some scene you can't see really well what is actually happening. The motions of the camera can make you suddenly feel motion sick, no joke.The plot are pretty predictable, but it's still pretty great how the production team can make you enjoy how the story flowed.The pros are that this movie really step out of the 'Comedic Fun Superheroes Movie' typical. It's serious, has a real issue for the character to face. It's more than just a superhero movie. It's about a growth of a man, a lifeshift of a 'prince' becoming a 'king'. It has become one of my favorite MCU movie after Civil War and Spider-Man Homecoming.I love the performance of Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan. Both did great. Michael B Jordan delivers 'swag' to his role, though. Which is awesome.
While Martin Freeman is just being Bilbo Baggins, CIA version. (IYKWIM)Musics are great. You will really love it.Overall this movie is doing great. It makes you getting more excited and can't wait for the upcoming Avengers All Star movie, a.k.a The Infinity War.</review-text>

		<review-text>Firstly I've got to hand it to Marvel. They have not only created one of the most impressive shared universes ever established in cinema history but they consistently keep bringing quality movies to the masses year after year. Not all have been earth shattering masterpieces but almost all have been of above average quality and always entertaining. Without beating around the bush, Black Panther is yet another great addition to this shared Marvel universe and has just enough character and style of its own to make it stand out from the others. The element of Black Panther I absolutely loved was the overarching story and the motivations behind all the characters. Never have I been more closely connected with each and every character in a Marvel film as I did in this one. To fully understand why they were doing what they were doing and what was driving them. Refreshingly even the main villain had a genuine reason for his actions and at times even made me question why I was so against him and routing for the other guys. This mash-up of motives and emotions really set Black panther apart from the rest. Not only that but the acting is of some of the highest quality there is. Stand out performance was Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger. This guy just demanded your attention and completely owned every scene he was in. He balanced the dislike you felt for him perfectly and I found myself flitting from hatred to understanding numerous times throughout, by far one of my favourite villains in a Marvel film in a long time. Chadwick Boseman returns as the main protagonist after we first met him in 2016's Captain America Civil War and I was excited to see him again, although his performance didn't blow me away and he seemed to lack that special something that I get from the other MCU players. Now I mentioned I loved the story and the message it brings with it however I did feel the plot itself was quite predictable and cliché, there simply isn't all that much excitement to go around. No nerve in the core of the story, almost everything you expect to happen, happens. As great as the special effects are and as fun as some of the character scenes are, nothing is very memorable. There wasn't a single moment throughout the entire film that made me sit forward in my seat or really get my pulse going. To put it in context, I got that tingly excitement within the run time of the latest infinity war trailer, but not once through the 2h 14min runtime of Black Panther. As mentioned in a few other Marvel origin stories, the lack of emotion from me as a viewer is possibly linked to the fact we already know T'Challa (Black Panther) will appear in the next movie and is likely to get a number of sequels of his own... No amount of death fake outs will have that emotional tug on me the creators are so desperately trying to make me feel. This is perhaps something impossible to avoid when you have a universe such as this but it undoubtedly takes away any kind of worry you may have for the main superhero. One element the movie excels in is in its special effects. The majority of the film takes place in the fiction city of Wakanda and its mighty impressive, with its own unique mash-up of a technically advanced civilisation that still holds onto its ancient culture. The costumes, makeup, and excellent original soundtrack is something to behold. So as the plot plays out rather passively with little in the shape of memorable moments, Black Panther does bring with it a wonderful message of a world coming together and touches on a number of things that are quite prominent in today's current political climate. Marvel should be applauded for bringing together such a rich and diverse cast and creating a wonderfully unique world within its ever expanding universe. It expertly manages to establish the soul of T'Challa, his moral standpoints and his capabilities, and sets him up perfectly going into Avengers Infinity War.</review-text>

		<review-text>For the time being, I have to say that I went into &quot;Black Panther&quot; with relatively few expectations. My love for superhero movies has become increasingly diminished over time. Not irresponsible of course is Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy, which (especially &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;) makes most MCU movies look like a kindergarten. Even in spite of the good feedback from the critics (88 Metacritic), I mainly went to the cinema with two friends to have an entertaining, not necessarily memorable Saturday evening in 3D. What makes Black Panther good? Obviously it's the visuals, which is something that seems to be really bombastic in many MCU movies. From the sound effects, to the well used CGI and the colorful camera shots, the visuals are really sensational. 
The film has a strong pacing and a good sense of urgency. It never drags. The action scenes are all strongly staged and also very exciting. Especially the Car Chase towards the beginning with the many camera angles, the great speed and entertaining gadgets. The black Panther Attire looked really great too. Surprisingly, the humor was actually solid. Of course, there were not the biggest laughs in here, but sometimes I could not resist the one or other grin. Black Panther also thrives on the really good acting performances. Surprisingly, I knew quite a few actors from the main cast. To be honest, none other than Martin Freeman &amp; Daniel Kaluuya. For me, Andy Serkis was surprisingly cool as &quot;Ulysses Klaue&quot;, who was really good at his job despite very little screen time. Chadwick Boseman as hero &amp; protagonist plays well, but the real show stealer was his antagonist. Michael B. Jordan plays the villain in a very convincing but also authentic manner. Maybe the characters aren't all as memorable as in other Superhero movies, but the ensemble is bigger for that. So there is one or two (very superficial) Punch-In-The-Gut moments. 
&quot;Black Panther&quot; also has a good dramaturgy. The scenery is fluidly designed and continues to build up systematically.
The great &quot;Epic&quot; film doesn't really emerge, but the final battle is staged together with the music score in a very exciting way. A lot of criticism (mainly from conventional audiences) that the film has had to deal with refers to the tribalism. Some see some kind of &quot;propaganda&quot; in here. Frankly, there may have been 1/2 minor implications or provocations regarding this problem, but nothing that put me personally out of the movie
What you have to notice is that the plot is, as with so many MCU movies, very predictable and partly repetitive.
The strands of action are put together quite unpretentiously. A lot of &quot;aha&quot; is not behind it, but in return, not much is done wrong. The storyline isn't that interesting and more or less very predictable.
The other points of criticism I would like to raise are closely related. The Character Delevopment did not exist in the end, because it was traded according to clichés and monotonous characteristics and therefore had a lot to do with continuous storytelling. The dialog was also quite constructed. Not bad in any way, just don't memorable or special.Does Black Panther have a high recognition value in the genre?
Yes, but also no.
The Parallel Society or even &quot;World&quot; of Wakanda is original and the visual and the atmosphere differs from other action flicks. Superficially seen &quot;Black Panther&quot; is therefore really unique. Nevertheless, many things like character development, dialogue, hero/villain relationship are quite repetitive and offer little to nothing special.
---
CONCLUSION: Black Panther is a visually sensational film with good pacing and strongly staged action scenes, but not really outstanding in its genre. It is really good at what he is supposed to be and fills the classic superhero formula with 1/2 squiggles. Is it as good as Christopher Nolan's Batman movies? No, for God's sake, of course not. Is it a movie you should watch at the cinema or maybe buy on Blu-Ray? Yeah.

		<review-text>The story is straightforward enough. The prologue is set in 1992, where a much younger King T'Chaka visits one of his War Dogs (Wakandans who are supposed to impartially spy on the Outside World) who turns out to be his younger brother Prince N'Jobu! Charges of treason are leveled against the prince, following which......the movie fast-forwards 24 years.That's right. The bulk of the movie is set one week after the ending of CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. And the bulk of the script has been brilliantly adapted from the debut story arc in Marvel Comics' &quot;Jungle Action.&quot; A magazine of the 1970's that helped revive reader interest in Prince T'Challa after his departure from the Silver Age comic book Avengers, ten years earlier. And which first introduced then-teenagers like me to such memorable characters as Erik Killmonger; M'Baku the Man-Ape; and Monica Lynn.Sadly, the latter has been replaced by another, more geographically convenient love interest; the Lady Nakia. But, the other two are still around and refreshingly updated for the 2010's. M'Baku, in particular! In the comics, his tribe/clan worshipped white gorillas (as part of a cult outlawed by the more dominant Panther Clan). Yet, in this movie, they worship a West African avatar of Hanuman (the Hindu monkey god).* While Erik Killmonger goes from being a common mercenary to someone with an initially mysterious grudge against T'Challa. Hence, the former's eventual double-cross of Ulysses Klaw (who, btw, goes from East European mad scientist-changed-into-creature-of-living sound, in the comic books, to expatriate South African cyborg in the film).* I don't want to give away too much of the rest of the story. Suffice it to say that Chadwick Boseman gave just as convincing a performance as T'Challa as he did in CA:CW. Thereby making the two hour-and-then-some running time fly by relatively fast. Including the now-customary sneaky epilogues during the ending credits! One strange thing, though. Based on all the advance person-on-the-street interviews I saw on the six o'clock news, this movie was hailed as a revolutionary (and long overdue) first step in bringing an African-American superhero to the silver screen. So, why was most of the audience who went to see this at my hometown multiplex...of the Caucasian persuasion?Ah, well!**Don't ask. Just enjoy.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is about King T'challa returning home to mourn his fathers death and become the new ruler of Wakanda. But the king first has to take care of obstacles, mainly his fathers nemesis, and a challenger for the throne.This film is co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler (Creed), the other writer is Joe Robert Cole (American Crime Story). It stars Chadwick Boseman (Captain America: Civil War) as the titular Black Panther, Michael B. Jordan (Creed) as the villainess Erik Killmonger and Academy Award Winner Lupita Nyong'o (12 Years a Slave) as Black Panthers love interest Nakia.This film is outstanding to look at, the visual effects for the film are great expecially the backgrounds of Wakanda. the direction is fantastic aswell, with director Ryan Coogler using long takes and gorgeous landscape shots. The score by Ludwig Goransson (Creed) is fantastic as well. What I love most about Black Panther though is that it is unlike any other marvel movie, focusing on the characters more than action and comedy makes it stand out from other marvel movies. Which makes it more memorable. The cast is great, the stand outs are Martin Freeman (The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey) as Everett K. Ross and Letitia Wright (The Commuter) as Black Panthers sister Shuri.I loved this film, in my opinion this is the best Marvel movie yet.10/10</review-text>

		<review-text>What's with all the Panther bashing?A wide mix of user reviews is fine and perfectly normal for a big budget blockbuster, but 1 and 2 star reviews for an extremely accomplished popcorn flick is unacceptable.
I am not usually one to defend the critics (for me, their recent cynical critique of The Greatest Showman completely missed the point of the movie), but they generally have Black Panther spot on, at a time when Hollywood is finally starting to face some of it's demons.Let's deal with the big black elephant in the room first...
I felt very uncomfortable recently when I heard a local radio DJ recommend the movie &quot;...that stars Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis&quot;.
Basically the only two white actors in a movie which is quite deliberately (and justifiably) NOT white.
It's a black superhero movie - big deal right?
Most of the cast and crew are black - that actually IS a big deal, and has some pretty major relevance too if you've followed the news even slightly over the past few years.
That fact alone though is probably a good reason to sign a petition or turn up to a rally but not necessarily a reason to go to the cinema. So let's move on.The action is great fun without being too excessive. The vast majority of characters are well fleshed out compared to the usual 'making up the numbers or two many cooks' in these films. And it has just the right amount of heart and mind without diluting the genre. I thought it also just managed to be different enough from the other MCU flicks to have it's own identity. Which is an achievement in itself at a time when they're churning out three of these babies a year.For what it's worth, I really enjoyed it and so did my kids.Sure, there's some overlong sequences, poorly delivered lines and the odd dodgy special effect, but that criticism can be levelled at ninety percent of the multiplex movies nowadays.Personally I was very happy to see a big budget, mainstream film that gave significance to more than just one or two non-white characters. BUT MORE THAN THAT, I was proud to take my young (white) daughter to a family film that featured a range of strong women who did much more than just spend the duration pouting, bitching or trying to make love to the camera.So if you don't like minor elements of social, political or topical discussion in your blockbuster I suggest you stick to Michael Bay films. If you don't like the way different movie directors are putting their own stamp on your beloved comics, stick to the comics.I've only seen it once, but I'm still trying to decide if Black Panther might topple Civil War as my favourite Marvel movie so far.Like it? Great. Don't like it? No problem.
But the 1 and 2 star reviewers can go suck balls, watch the Emoji Movie, and stop insulting most people's intelligence.I give it a solid 8/10.</review-text>

		<review-text>I am an avid DC fan. I am humbled and moved by this film. There are so many powerful messages interwoven although it. It does political, racial, and family values in one sitting. Sad as it is to say, anyone who rates this low wasn't watching the movie. You were looking for a superhero movie, but surprise.. its not a superhero movie. Marvel was making a giant statement; heroes come in all colors. As easy as it is to dismiss when most superheroes have been white, its good to see something different. I don't want them to stop at this. I look forward to other nationalities to bring forward some encouraging and uplifting heroes the children of their origin can identify with in cinema. You can downplay the cinema when you've always taken for granted that you had someone to look up to or aspire to be like, but this is new for many of us that haven't. I applaud this. The cinematography, the acting, the storytelling; all incredibly outstanding.</review-text>

		<review-text>This film defied the expectations of the superhero film. Intimate, yet grande. Personal yet universal. This film was fantastic and nearly without flaw. As usual a pro's and con's list.Cons -Ryan Coogler is inexperienced when it comes to CGI so it's acceptable that his first mega budget feature film would have some dodgy CGI and this really only comes into the third act. The kiss between Nakia and T'Challa was iffy.And literally that is it, everything else about this film was brilliant.Pros -Chadwick Boseman is the King of Wakanda. He is brilliant, conflicted, nuanced and powerful both physically and emotionally. A King was born in Civil War and he has kept that title.Michael B Jordan was also very good (though not as good as everyone has claimed) in his role. You understand his motives and his scenes with his father were seriously emotional.Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira were impeccable as Nakia and Okoye. Both had great scenes, fantastic dialogue and it was great too see two powerful women of colour in leading roles.Daniel Kaluuya and Winston Duke were also in respectable roles. Kaluuya working very well with what he was given and Duke rising through the scenes he shared with strong A listers. Angela Bassett and Letita Wright were great as T'Challa's family. Bassett wasn't really given much to do but was very realistic within the more emotional scenes. Wright was also very entertaining to watch and the future implications for her character are very exciting. Yet another star is born.Forest Whitaker, Sterling K Brown, John Kani, Seth Carr, Denzel Whitaker and Atandwa Kani were among my favourites. They all brought raw emotion, gravitas and pure empathy for their characters. Brilliant work.Finally, Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman were given less to do but were solid within their roles. I just can't help but feel Serkis was a little wasted in the MCU but still nevertheless very entertaining and always fun to watch.Side note it was great too see Alex R Hibbert (Little from Moonlight) in a small role.Wakanda is so beautiful and glorious to watch as is the action that unfolds within.The humour was perfect and in the right places. Very pleased it was not overbearing.The opening was breathtaking and had me on edge.Some of the dialogue such as Killmonger's final line were completely riveting. The entire spiritual side of this film was so beautiful and emotional it was so glorious to see this side of a superhero and it made for some genuine raw emotion. The costumes were brilliant as were the weapons and the cultural tribes of Wakanda.The social commentary was the most important and honestly breathtaking parts of the film. The way it was current and fresh was just so right and Coogler has really made this film his own. The commentary on certain events just felt so right to include within this film.Overall this film was just so damn good. The racial / social commentary was so relevant, the action sequences were so exciting, the cast are all on point and most importantly this film is both so intimate yet grande in regards to the MCU. The entire cast and of course Ryan Coogler should be commended for showcasing the beautiful world of Wakanda.Wakanda Forever!</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther (2018, Ryan Coogler)We first saw the African superhero 'Black Panther' in Captain America: Civil War and now we see him on his home turf and find out about the origins and history of the royal hero. The film itself is very afrocentric with a great and mostly black cast including Czhadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Forest Whitaker, Lupita Nyong'o and Angela Bassett as well as a a host of lesser known young talent. I was surprised to feel shades of a James Bond style adventure for the first act before it moved to something else but I did enjoy that while it lasted.One of the many things I like about this film is the tone as it deals with some pretty relevant and serious racial subject matter with respect and class. Also, where as many of the more recent Marvel films have gone for a more slapstick and one-liners approach, this film uses a more natural humour that does not take you out of the film but enhances it. It has a strong script that fleshes out a lot of the characters and makes their motivations believable and clear even when in unbelievable settings. At no stage are anyone's actions leaving you scratching your head and it is the strength of the script, characters and acting that helps one overlook the films few shortcomings.Where the film falters is in the action sequences and cgi. A lot of the special effects look unfinished or as if they might've been done ten or more years ago. The wardrobe design is excellent but some of the vehicle design could have been better. The worst offender for me though was the combat sequences which were often dark, overly edited and shaky. I was surprised at this because the director's boxing work on his film Creed (2015) was some of the best I have seen but here it was a mess. However the belief in the characters and what they are fighting for can still make you invested in these scenes despite their unpleasant presentation.All in all, I think this was a home-run for Marvel, yet again doing a great job with one of their lesser known comic book properties. I expect this film to do big business world wide and should please most as it feels like a real film, with real characters and stakes and not just disposable popcorn entertainment. It is a shame some of the special effects feel so rushed but I guess deadlines have to be met to keep the MCU juggernaut moving along and quality control will suffer here and there.7-7.5/10</review-text>

		<review-text>I sat at the movies on preview night with a full audience of laughing and impressed viewers. Including my husband and daughter- not am easy crowd to please. Marvel has walked the fine line between continuity with the Marvel universe and ingenuity. They took the formula that is distinctly Marvel, mixed it with the basis of the Black Panther storyline and added a modern twist. The cinematography in a second to none and while the fight scenes were by no means the focal point of the movie they were none the less epic. You can't take anything away from this movie without purposely throwing shade on what Marvel and the director Retrying to accomplish. We went into this movie with high expectations and I can Say unequivocally that we were not disappointed. We were pleasantly surprised with spider man homecoming and its unintentional inclusivity and blown away by Black Panther's meaningful, thoughtful and purposeful redefining of everyone's view of what it can mean to be African. They blew away every stereotype, while remaining true to the comic.For people that say was predictable I say you put them in a catch-22 because if they veer from the Marvel story line then there's no continuity and it's not authentically Black Panther. They managed to tell the story, tell it well, make it beautiful , make it believable and make it congruous in such a way that you can have a Black Panther 2,3 and 4, and he can come back and join the Avenger as needed.
They captured the technological marvel that vibranium can bring when harnessed with the genius that Black Panther was known for, though they ascribed that genius to an independent, youthful little sister. Great twist there.
Someone complained about the single remote controlled plane, well Iron Man could have made multiple suits but he only made 1 to share with his wingman. In the same way, Shuri didn't water down her technology by putting it on am assembly line. 
To those who complained about them fighting their own people. Yea, think about it. Who else could even hold a prayer of matching wits and weapons with them. The Claw already made the point in the first fight scene. &quot; Those are vibranium cars, Idiots. Your bullets are useless.&quot; The General brought the point home when the rhino stopped charging and smooches her face instead. That was Her Rhino to command. They took the theme of Civil War- or pained me to see The Avengers fighting each other tooth and nail- and made it even more personal. This was family against family and friend against friend. Having never read the comics, they evoked the same feelings of remorse for the fight that Civil War did in a single movie. That takes serious character development. 
And yes I had a tough time believing that T'Challa's life long friend would turn so quickly but many of us have experienced misplaced loyalties. He got caught up in the movement for all the wrong reasons.
I've seen enemy Avenger movie on the big screen except Guardians and Fantastic Four and this topped them all. Hands down. 
No one is peperfect and this IS a superhero movie- a genre not known for being deep- but this one went there. Rightfully so. They needed to go a little deep. They needed to explore the taboo subject of responsibility. Black Panther was breaking new ground when it came out in the comics. The movie had to live up to the legacy. Paving the way. Like Jackie Robinson. When you're first, you have to blaze the trail for everyone that follows. This movie set the bar high. I can't wait to see Falcon star in his breakthrough movie.</review-text>

		<review-text>1. Overall: 8/10; Not as great as some of the rave reviews on imdb, but not bad at all. Good that the plotline is different to other Marvel solo movies which simply recycle Iron Man (like Ant Man or Dr Strange did). The plot is actually quite good and coherent.2. Almost Isolated: Yes the only connection to the MCU comes in the post-credits scene where we see Bucky recovering. But, while it worked in this movie i hope th2 upcoming phase 4 movies are not all so isolated from each other. I personally liked the concept of MCU characters appearing in each others' movies and giving a real sense of continuity.3. Klaue - Serkis: Wasted; in that they wasted a great actor on a character who is ultimately used as a pawn and eliminated early. Andy Serkis got waaaay less screen time than i would have liked.4. Finally a relatable villain: Although he was tamed by T'Challa in the end; N'Jabanga (or wtv his name is) is actually a compelling character. Want to see more of that in the MCU</review-text>

		<review-text>What's good: The power packed action sequences and graphics give you a visual bonanza that warrants a positive rewiew when you leave the theatre. The 3D effects make it even more stunning!! Get ready to dive into the mystical world of Wakanda, with their picturesque landscapes, vibranium modified animals, unique rituals, and...... Wierd looking people.
What's not really good: The storyline would have been awesome, if you hadn't seen it, like a thousand times. No efforts to make to make it even a little bit less cliche. And the black panther seems like a distant cousin of the batman, you know with the technology and stuff.
I think you have better acting potential with some of the antagonists. Personally I feel Michael jordan leaves a better impact that anybody else.
What you have to do: Go to a facny theatre,take your girlfriend, grab some popcorn, take a cozy seat, , give your intellectual Nazi's some rest, and just watch. Yes.its okay if you dont have a girlfriend.</review-text>

	<review id="599">
		<review-text>Black Panther is like a checklist. A checklist that fulfills every aspect and almost goes above and beyond. The film is unapologetically African and it subtly deals with real political issues. I'd argue the film is almost on par with the first Iron Man, the first Avengers, and the Captain America trilogy.Ryan Coogler has proven himself as a capable director in his own right, with Creed and Fruitvale Station, and now he's three for three with Black Panther. Coogler puts the characters and the narrative(albeit kinda predictable) first before the action and spectacle. I'd like to mention though some of the cinematography is gorgeous so kudos to Rachel Morrison. Costume designs are fabulous so another kudos to Ruth E. Carter. Last but not least to the visual development team, Ryan Meinerding, Andy Park, Carla Ortiz, and the others. I don't know if any of you ever picked up the concept art-books of the MCU films, but these guys and girls put a lot of effort into coming up with the creative look of each film. Coogler and Joe Robert Cole explore some thought-provoking ideas such as isolationism, revolution, and the cultures of oppression. They tackle real world problems without being too preachy or over the top, but enough to get the point across in an effective manner. If you have the strongest and not to mention the most versatile metal on Earth, I would doubt you'd want to share that kind of info to the world, but then again you can also do so much to help others in need. With that being said, this is where Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger is effective. The performance is kind of over the top, but it registers and you can sorta feel his rage and anger. He's definitely not the wasted villain that the MCU is notorious for. As I've mentioned before, the Phase 3 villains, while not perfect, are a step up to every other villain the MCU has given us aside from Loki, Red Skull, and Winter Soldier. Jordan's portrayal while again, slightly over the top, makes you see his point of view like The Vulture or Zemo. The women also are a stand out. Angela Bassett's role doesn't have too much to do but her acting chops alone make you believe in her relationship with T'Challa. Letitia Wright provides a lot humor as the sharp witted Wakandan genius and sister to T'Challa, Shuri. Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira are also highlights as Nakia and General Okoye. Nyong'o and Boesman don't overplay their complicated/romantic relationship and Gurira's character butts heads with T'Challa frequently, but is also fiercely loyal to her king. Other cast members are solid. I certainly didn't expect Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya, and Martin Freeman to have the roles that they did, so kudos to Coogler and Robert Cole for figuring out all those moving parts. Especially Kaluuya's role as W'Kabi. Winston Duke and Andy Serkis just chew up the scenery with their roles as well. Particularly Serkis, as it was nice seeing Ulysses Klaue make his return. Now on to Chadwick Boseman. He is so good in this role I forget the accent he speaks with in this film is just him acting. When I watched interviews with him I totally forgot he has the American accent. He's equally believable as a superhero, but as a man grieving for his father and questioning his ability to be a fitting king. Yes the film is by the numbers, kinda predictable, and by the books, yes some of the special effects don't look as polished to be quite honest, the action set pieces are competent but not mind-blowing, and the shaky camera was a bit of an annoyance. With that being said, being a comic-book geek I am pleased with the final result and I cannot wait to see what Marvel Studios has in store for T'Challa next. Black Panther has been quite the talk lately as there have been many opinions about the significance of a black superhero. Let us not forget about Wesley Snipes's Blade, but up until Black Panther's release, much of Hollywood considered a film with an all black cast as niche for certain demographics, but never as a blockbuster or a franchise like this. Like Wonder Woman, Black Panther will open even more doors for movies similar to them, and everyone associated with this movie on another level. 8.8/10</review-text>

		<review-text>This is my short review about Black Panther. Well, the story is pretty standard and cliche for superhero movies. I can say that the ending in accordance with most audiences. Introduction to some characters recognition has deficiencies in the introduction and thus affecting the presence and impact of this film plot, but not all of it.one of the things that impressed me so much about this movie was the musical score. Background music in some scenes uses music and instruments typically from African culture. Color patterns in costumes and places are very diverse and pamper the eyes. Wakanda's depiction is presented with great CGI and some very futuristic technology. The production design that is very different from previous Marvel films and carries African culture as its main theme. As well as the acting of some main characters are incredible. I was very impressed with Michael B. Jordan's acting as Erik Killmonger. In this film, Erik is described as very evil, cunning and intelligent but can steal the attention of the audience.Overall, this movie is my recommendation if you want to watch a different movie superhero, in terms of themes, production design and music score.</review-text>

The clothing, the culture, the history, the tech, the art; done with great care and vision. I love panthers, rhino's and culture, I'm very happy. A bit more humor would've been nice but I suppose more humor and it would've been accused of not taking Africa serious. M'Baku, Shuri and one scene with Nakia and Okoye was funny, that was all.Most of the times, music was appropriate. No fan of rap here but it could've been a lot worse.I was most turned down by Erik, who is an incredibly handsome man but I didn't feel the strong warrior in the rather upset boy he portrayed. 
As villain an excellent political choice; the despair of a youth resulting in a man executing despair, causing political mayhem all around him. It was hard not to feel for him and still have to strike back. 
The effects of isolationism and the lifting of it was too simplistic; I'm not sure if this was a result of a referendum or decided by royal decree but if by decree; fueling a few egos to help others in seemingly altruistic moves while sacrificing their own, is not altruistic but selfish ('Not a king of the world but a king of Wakanda'). They could've helped and remain anonymous thus saving their own folk for unlike every other country in the world, they didn't need anything or anyone else but now soon they will; they will suffer losses for coming out of hiding and won't gain anything from it.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is a solid portrayal of a deep comic book character and one of the better Marvel films, utilizing exciting direction from the always proficient Ryan Coogler and pronounced acting from Boseman, B. Jordan (the best in the film by far), Nyong'o, Serkis, and Gurira. My major cons with the film included the overuse of CGI and jump-cut action, both expected staples for modern Marvel films, alongside the 2+ hour run time felt which grew tedious by the third act. Definently worth the watch before Infinity War.</review-text>

		<review-text>BLACK PANTHER (2018) *** 1/2 Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Sterling K. Brown, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis. Marvel continues to be marvelous in their latest franchise addition with Boseman oozing charm and stoicism as the titular hero and African king of the fictitious Wakanda, who faces his new empire with the imposing threat by Jordan's menacing, vengeance seeking cousin hellbent on using their nation's natural resource - vibranium - to expose their country's secrecies to the world. Filmmaker Ryan Coogler - who co-wrote the screenplay with Joe Robert Cole - spreads his canvas with bold color, sharp designs and eye-popping visual effects and set pieces (the car chase is a humdinger) and wisely allows his supporting cast - namely the trifecta of actresses Nyong'o as the smart, sexy love interest Nakia; Gurira (bad ass all the way) as Okoye the lead warrior of T'Challa's kingdom and scene-stealer/secret weapon Wright (funny, bright and sharp as a tack) as his kid sister and Q to his Bond, genius tech inventor - to in many ways overshadow the lead yet steer him steadily into battle. Geeks will be all giddy as well to see an onscreen reunite of Gollum and Bilbo Baggins (Serkis and Freeman, respectively as a villain and FBI agent/comrade to the King). Kudos to Ludwig Goransson's royale score and Ruth E. Carter's majestic costumes. All hail!</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther: To the outside world Wakanda is a struggling country, caught in the past, dependent on agriculture with little to export. Little does the West know that in fact Wakanda is an advanced technological society, its industry and wealth built on the Alien metal Vibranium. The Black Panther gets his power from a flower grown in soil tainted by Vibranium ore. (This being an Absolute Monarchy only he gets to ingest the flower. Don't ask this is comic book territory).Following the death of King T'Chaka in the attack on the UN, T'Challa ( Chadwick Boseman) the Black Panther prepares to assume the throne. The kingdom maintains agents (War Dogs) in the outside world, one of whom is Nakia (Lupito Nyong'o), T'Challa's ex-lover, who is currently undercover fighting slavers. This allows BP to show off his powers in a fight with the slavers aided by Nakia and Okoye (Danai Gurira) leader of his female Special Forces, the Dora Milaje. The DM protect the Royal Family and Wakanda from internal and external attack (and presumably disembowel any uppity oiks who are looking for an elected president and parliament).T'Challa and his sidekicks return to Wakanda for the Coronation ceremony where he has to take a potion stripping him of his powers before any possible challenge. He is challenged by M'Baku (Winston Duke), leader of the Mountain People. T'Challa triumphs and allows M'Baku to live. But there is a lost Prince of Wakanda on the loose abroad, N'Jadaka (Michael Jordan) AKA Killmonger. This Prodigal Prince teams up with the murderous Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) a B List Bond Villain. They loot/liberate museums in search for Vibranium and N'Jadaka returns to Wakanda to challenge T'Challa for the throne.Wakanda is a beautifully imagined country surrounded by mountains and rain forest, hidden by shields which cloak the true nature of the country. Challenges for the throne take place at the edge of magnificent waterfalls, top class CGI for the most part. Apart from it's War Dogs occasional interventions, Wakanda has stayed aloof from the struggles of the oppressed. N'Jadaka wants to change this by sending advanced weapons abroad. Civil War ensues, with even Vibranium clad rhinos involved.The Wakandan technology ranges from dragonfly like attack craft to maglev trains and photon/energy powered Vibranium weapons. There is a vast subterranean cavern complex where the manufacture and R&amp;D takes place. Chief Scientist is Shuri (Letitia Wright), T'Challa's teenage sister. In supporting roles we have Angela Bassett as the Queen Mum, Forest Whitaker as Zuri, a wise old Counsellor and Martin Freeman as CIA agent Everett Ross. Ross is the butt of jokes as M'Baku roars: &quot;Silence or I'll feed you to my children! Only Kidding, we're vegetarians!&quot; Shuri comments: &quot;another broken white boy to fix&quot;. as Ross arrives for medical treatment.This film works on several layers with the spectres of Colonialism, Neo-Colonialism hanging over the action sequences. The meaning and natures of International Solidarity is also examined but sadly the anachronism of an Absolute Monarchy existing in an advanced Technological Society is left unquestioned. Good fun though. 8/10.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is both bold and nuanced, features about a dozen unique major characters and makes you care about each of them, and runs through an amazing story with thrilling narrative turns, all without feeling overcomplicated. And it's visually beautiful. It's a delight, simply put.Reviewers kneejerk-calling this film 'divisive' can only be explained by an ignorance of both world civilization history and current events, and an oversensitivity to topics they have the luxury of otherwise avoiding. The story and characters are NUANCED. Sometimes people do bad things while trying to do good things. This isn't new and it shouldn't be controversial in a story for adults. All stories have a political stance. Black Panther handles its own positively and well.</review-text>

		<review-text>1st off Michael B Jordan/Andy Serkis stole the show. GREAT Villains. Letitia Wright impressed me with her performance on the show Black Mirror. This movie needed her like humans need Air &amp; Music. She always lightened room the provided much needed laughter with subject matter that can serious at times. 
 
This disconnect in culture, feeling of abandonment, and shame of way we treated and still treat each other was touched on perfectly. The best way to enjoy this movie is to suspend your political &amp; personal beliefs if don't agree &amp; respect the storyteller.</review-text>

		<review-text>It's really unfortunate that some people can't seem to leave their biases at the door and review this movie for what it is. Black Panther is a fantastic movie - action packed, entertaining, engrossing, exciting - truly what an action movie experience should be. I think the critics' reviews are right on the money with this one. Some claim it is political - really? I hope they had the same complaint about Wonder Woman since she fought Nazis in that film. I thoroughly enjoyed Black Panther and can hardly wait to see it again on the big screen.</review-text>

		<review-text>Although both it and Thor: Ragnarok take place in glittering, futuristic kingdoms, Black Panther strikes a rather different note from the galactic romp vibe Ragnarok went for. Don't get me wrong: while it is rife with serious moments and dramatic tension (it would be hard not to, after Civil War!), and grapples with themes of loss and legacy, Black Panther does manage to smoothly deliver some well-timed comedy to lighten up the journey. Our theater adored Shuri, T'challa's irrepressible little sister, and I'm sure you will too.Many will zoom in, so to speak, on the visual richness of the film: African designs and aesthetic isn't something we see very much of in mainstream American media, to say nothing of our blockbusters, and the futuristic skyline of Wakanda has obviously been carefully crafted to make the city both unique and true to its roots. And the scenery is excellent, as is the costuming. However, the movie's strongest point, I feel is in its acting. Every one of the main cast delivered a memorable performance: Chad Bosewick is finally allowed to fully portray T'challa's grief and conflict to spectacular effect; Lupita Nyongo'o matches him scene for scene and is impossible to take your eyes off of; Michael B. Jordan manages to be at once terrifying, sympathetic and too compelling to make a truly tidy villain; Danai Gurira's screen presence and the sheer force of nature that is the character Okoye herself comes through from the very first time she steps onscreen, and sometimes without a single word spoken; and Letitia Wright dances effortlessly from the hilarious to the heartrending, stealing every scene she's in. I would need a lot more words and a lot more time to detail every performance that needed praising.So, while Black Panther is at its core a Marvel superhero movie, with the requisite cheese, heaping helping of action (Note: I'm not complaining, because that shit was fun as HELL), and some heavy-handedness in its political messaging (let's remember, though, Iron Man and Afghanistan and terrorism, terrorism, terrorism)... It's the chemistry and passion that both the actors/actresses and the film crew have put into this movie that form the heart of the story. It has the distinction of being the first Marvel movie that managed to make me well up, all while sitting at the edge of my seat and then being surprised into laughing by a deftly executed bit of slapstick or snark. It doesn't shy away from examining issues of racism, broken families, tradition vs. responsibility, pacifism vs. imperialism, and other uncomfortable topics that the world, but especially the U.S., could stand to reflect upon this year. It works through these issues to show us the characters moving towards a more hopeful future than any previous generation could have imagined, and isn't that what sci-fi is all about?Our theater loved this film. We laughed together, we cried together, we applauded together at the end. Thank you for a wonderful experience, Black Panther. I absolutely plan on seeing it again, and making sure the rest of my family does, too.</review-text>

		<review-text>A Humble HeroWhat you get from this movie is part action, part soap opera (with humor) and a great filler leading up to Avengers: Infinity War... Believe it or not, this movie is just as good as Winter Soldier and Civil War... The movie did a good job paying homage to African diaspora culture &amp; spirituality... Yes, the movie does make social critiques, which is what good movies, as a form of art does-share reflections on how far we've come as a society and how much more work needs to get done...The movie is in no way racist... It's actually a good strategic move for Marvel opening up the MCU to diverse worlds and characters... The acting is very good with Michael B. Jordan playing a menacing anti-hero... I know a lot of folks are surprised to see a predominantly black cast bring forth such strong performances but get over and use this movie as a springboard to learn more about other cultures besides the Eurocentric dominated media...The Black Panther soundtrack is on fireeeeeeeeeeeee... Yup.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is in fact all that they are talking about, if a few years ago I did not know the Black Panther Hero, when he appears in Civil War surprised me and 2 years later he wins a movie Solo, Black Phanter still continues in the Marvel formula, is a film that has jokes and has that comic tone, but it can still be different from the others, it implements the African culture very well in the film, it has a sensational soundtrack and a beautiful photograph, there are moments that can make a picture of so beautiful they are, and the story is very well told, merit to the great direction of Ryan Coogler who is a very good director and who has not erred, the cast is very good, Chadwick Boseman plays the character very well and can demonstrate expressions Michael B.Jordan is great as Killmonger, he is undoubtedly next to Loki the 2 best MCU videos, and he has the best motivation too, you can understand his motives and have times that you are not even angry with him, Lupita Nyong'o is great, Danai Gurira is one of the most interesting characters in the movie, Letita Wright is fine and the chemistry of her character with her brother T'CHalla is very good, Martin Freeman has a participation bigger than I imagined I liked him in the movie, Daniel Kaluuya is fine but I did not really like his character and his decisions in the film, I found it a bit forced, and the rest of the cast is competent, Andy Serkis is very good in the film as Ullyses Klaue, the action scenes of the film are good, but nothing surprising, there is no scene that will make you remember her after you leave the cinema, the film has a lot of politics involved and the film ends competently, Black Panther is a film, a of the best MCU movies, and possibly the most important film Marvel has ever made.

		<review-text>The Marvel Cinematic Universe has now been around for nearly a decade and not only has it matured as a franchise, but it has also evolved into something worth holding onto for generations to come. Sure, there are a few weak entries, but I don't think of this franchise as a series of movies anymore. This is a fantastic television series that's presented on the big screen a few times each year, that's had a few mediocre episodes along the way. Happily, Black Panther is their latest entry and not only is it far from mediocre, but it's easily the best film they've produced in quite some time. Look, I'm not going to sugar coat this review and call myself a fanboy who's blinded by the brand of Marvel. I genuinely thought this was a terrific entry and here's why.One of the best things about this film is that it stands on its own. Yes, seeing previous movies definitely elevates your experience, but it's been a long time since the Marvel Cinematic Universe released a movie that's not reliant on viewers having seen previous movies. That being said, Black Panther picks up not too long after the events of Captain America: Civil War. Don't let that be daunting to you or anyone who hasn't seen that film because this movie does a solid job at filling in the gaps without having to see that movie. The king of Wakanda has passed away and his son T'Challa has taken the mantle. With looming threats to have his throne stolen from him, he must take any precautions necessary in order to reign supreme. Quite honestly, unless you want this movie ruined for you, it's hard to expand on the premise itself, especially when it comes to the villain in Erik Killmonger.Everyone will want to discuss how well Chadwick Boseman fits into the role of T'Challa (Black Panther), but Michael B. Jordan is easily the highlight of this film. Once again, I'm not trying to let a highlight cloud my judgment of the movie as a whole, but the villain is honestly something remarkable here, especially for the standards that have been set by previous movies in this universe. His purpose for wishing to take down the titular hero will have you hating him and sympathizing with him all at the same time and that's when you know this character was created and presented with care. The interacting with Killmonger and the secondary character and the final few scenes that he and T'Challa get to spend together are honestly some of the best moments from any of these films in a very long time.Yes, I can admit that I loved this movie from start to finish, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the few aspects that bothered me. Normally when I watch a movie, I never let CGI affect how I feel about a scene as a whole, but there were some noticeably cheap-looking effects here. Now, that's really all I have to complain about here because it didn't take away from anything. They're definitely noticeable, but I also found myself invested and tearing up during a couple of the final scenes, even though someone's body or a background looked fake, so I have nothing but incredible applause for Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole on their fantastically written screenplay.In the end, superhero movies, in general, are hard to make these days, especially when many audience members seem to be growing weary of them. Personally, I think of this genre as any other genre. If you make a good film, then it's worthy of talking about, just as an indie drama that's up for Oscars is. This is a rich and wonderful world that's worth exploring. Superbly directed by Ryan Coogler, Black Panther is one of the best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and easily one of the best solo outings for a superhero.Has there ever been romantic comedy fatigue? No. Has there ever been horror film fatigue? No. People let themselves think they're having superhero movie fatigue because there are many of them made nowadays, but as I said, it doesn't matter if people have powers. A great movie is a great movie if you have a story worth telling, and Black Panther proves that statement tenfold. I can't recommend checking this film out enough. For comics fans and average moviegoers alike, I feel as though this will be a movie long-discussed.</review-text>

		<review-text>Just saw Marvels Black Panther and I thought it was AWESOME! I thought it was a fantastic look at some very much needed character development, in which Marvel movies tend to not do very well. PROS: GREAT Story. The narrative was easy to follow along, and kept you in the thicke of things. I never got lost. It was also very engaging.PROS: THE WORLD BUILDING. You get to see Wakanda and the city. Way better world building than Thor. You actually felt like your there in Wakanda.PROS: The visuals. Oh man, the visuals were breathtaking.PROS: The Direction. Ryan Cooglar put together a super hero film that felt like a indie drama that happens to have a super hero in it.PROS: The acting. Everyone gets to shine. And all the performances were great. Leticia Wright stole every scene. A few scenes will make you cry. There was so much emotion in this film.PROS: The Villain. Michael B Jordan is great in this, and Marvel finally gave us a great villain. You start understanding where he is coming from, and you actually start feeling for him.PROS: Not a comedy. Hated that Thor Ragnarock was basically a comedy. Marvel films always have tons of jokes in it. Not this one. The jokes here come natural, and not forced.PROS: NOT political. I was told this movie was political. It was from a standpoint of people trying to take the throne, but not political, in a us political. It did feel like Game of Thrones in some areas.CONS: CGI. The final fight was too cgi heavy. It didn't ta me me out of the movie, but it was too cartoonie. CONS: Not enough fighting without the suit from T'Challa. And they downplayed his genius.All in all, I give it a 10/10 and in my opinion, BEST standalone film by Marvel.</review-text>

		<review-text>Did I miss something? I swear, there is nothing about this film that's by any stretch is extraordinary or new or even worthy of an 88/100 on Metacritic. I'm expecting Lord of the Rings level here. If you're giving it that much praise, there's gotta' be something spectacular here. No, It's just another Marvel Blockbuster that recycles it's curriculum stories through and through it's exhausting. I mean, if someone can enlighten me and tell me the one or two things that make this such a groundbreaking, high-rated Superhero flick, then please. Because whatever is good in this movie is good, but it's delivers as much as any other comic book pic. Sure, it was a fun ride, well made, and a good time at the movies. But were there samples of cocaine handed out to critics in their screenings? Because this is no better than any Marvel movie that's come out in the last 5 years. In fact, I could name you 5 better superhero movies that have released in the last 3.
Listen, it's a good movie, but It never went to that place or convinced me it was worthy of all it's praise. It's clearly just overly-excited reviewers who want this to be good, and are are so consumed by the culture, that among all of our social insecurities sprinkled across social media, we just can't get enough of black guys in panther suites. Trust me, go and see this, but it's as good as any other Marvel movie. But their accents are pretty bad ass, I'll give you that.</review-text>

		<review-text>Its completely different from any marvel movie till date.This just wasn't what people were expecting I guess. But its a really good movie makes you think about a lot of problems in today's world. the soundtrack is a blast, The whole cast did a great job though I wished Jordan got a bit more screen time. The ending just blew me away. So simple yet so satisfying. The movies greatness lies in the fact that it challenges you to think and choose who to support the hero or the villain, both whose causes are justified, and . You kind of end up feeling sad for the bad guy, just fighting for what he thinks is right. No other marvel movie delivers this sort of experience.Sure its not as action packed or funny as other marvel movies but it doesn't rely on these elements, instead it drags you into the story and makes you feel the pain and conflict inside each character, expressed so elegantly you can almost feel them come to life.Many people probably went to the theaters expecting a high action flick with a guy running in a bullet proof cat suit and some comedy thrown in to the mix. This could've been like that but no, they decided to make something different , a different class of movie, more focused on internal struggles than fist fights, that is the strongest point of the movie. If you don't like it I understand, it just wasn't a general superhero movie. Maybe try watching the movie again without thinking of it as a superhero film, but just a normal movie with a social message, you might like it.</review-text>

		<review-text>Spoliers ahead
First, let me say I did go into this film with very high expectations because of the hype surrounding the film, as well as the nature of what the film represented to a group of people. Most of all, because I'm a avid collector of comics books and black panther happens to be one those series that I collect. In general it is very hard for me to sit through a film adaption of a comic book and look at it from a objective point of view. I always find myself wanting to compare it to the source material, and normally I end up disappointed-not because the film is bad per se, but because it doesn't live up to my expectations. 
There have been very few films that have been point on that I've loved. Deadpool, Kickass, the Watchmen, and even though Logan wasn't the version of old man Logan I would of loved to see on the big screen, I loved that film as well. I could even appreciate some aspects of Christopher Nolan's version of Batman. But we're not here to talk about those films, this is about Black Panther. 
The film follows T'Challa as he steps into his role as king (I'll try hard not to put too many spoilers or story material in here for those who are still going to see it). The events of this film follow after Captain America civil war. T'Challa is back in his country Wakanda, fictional African nation that is described as the most technologically advanced place in the world. This is due to a very valuable and rare metal called vibranium. T'Challa's goal is to ensure that his people are safe and by doing this, he sets to continue to keep Wakanda a secret. T'Challa believes if the world knew how advanced Wakanda was and knew that they were storing the virabium then his people would surely be attacked by outsiders. 
Now, the villain of the film, Killmonger, who I won't go into specific detail about, is the opposite of T'Challa. He is a black militant. Actually, I'll even dare to say that he holds true to the real black panthers' (from the 1960's) way of thinking. Killmonger wants to not only take over Wakanda but he wants to use its advanced resources to do what others have done to his people. Colonize. He believes that the they should use Wakanda's technology to arm their people around to world to overthrow their oppressors and take over every other country. 
The story more or less revolves around this conflict of thinking. And while watching it I couldn't help but to think of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcom x. As well as Professor Xavier and Magneto whose ways of thinking we're based on the aforementioned. One wanted to take over the world or overthrow those who oppressed them/hated them. While the other sought to co-exist with those who were different from them-to show them over time that they were the same.
This is the stance the story pretty much takes and in the end, T'Challa agrees with Killmonger to an extent. Instead of taking over the world he wants to extend his resources by educating and building up black communities around the world. There are a lot of political elements thrown into the film that brush upon current issues. Past issues and reoccurring issues. And the director does an excellent job of building this into the film while making it entertaining for anyone to be able to enjoy. 
He also does a great job of showcasing black panther in a positive light. A hero who has his faults and fails at times but finds a way to overcome his doubts and weaknesses. He beautifully melds aspects of African culture into a fictional universe as well as properly represents the background characters as not just warriors, but also elegant and intelligent people. I think all of these things are not only true to the source material, but also important for other African Americans, especially those of a young age,
to see. It gives them something to be proud of. It gives them characters they can not only relate to, but look up to and strive to be like the powerful intelligent people that those actors were portraying. 
There were some minor things about the film that I thought could of been touched up on like the fighting, which I thought was a tad choppy at times especially towards the climax. And the cgi I felt could of been a little better especially towards the end when Black Panther and T'Challa was fighting. I also couldn't help but to think of he lion king at times during the film but again those were minor things to a film that I thought lived up to the hype it created. 
The movie was easy to follow even for someone who has not watched captain America civil war or read any of the Black Panther comic books. The plot was engaging and informing, and the people and culture were beautiful to watch on the big screen. There was a great mixture of action and comedy, as well as drama. In the end, it's a Marvel film, but definitely one of the better ones in my opinion. I would definitely recommend it.</review-text>

	<review id="622">
		<review-text>There's great character development in such a short time in this movie for mostly all the characters and that's it's strong point. The great feeling you get when they first arrive to the Wakanda is unmatched. It's a complicated and compelling family that comes together nicely. The overall theme of the togetherness and how the decisions of few affect many is never lost and constant throughout. All of the characters contain likeability, including the villains, which is very rare for a movie. This movie is a lot to take in within one watch, I myself have seen it three times already. Even though it feels like there's too much in this movie overall, it is truly excellent. If you're not a fan of political and racial truths, this movie is not for you at all. It's more of a movie that happens to be a comic book, more than it is a comic book movie.</review-text>

		<review-text>Let's be honest, even if the movie is called Black Panther, it's really about all of Wakanda, and the women of Wakanda who steal the show! Shuri is the best Disney Princess ever, with more snark than Leia, more fight than Mulan, and more brains than Belle. If you want a movie with multiple, three-dimensional female characters in a wide variety of roles, than look no further than Black Panther. ...that Chadwick Boseman guy ain't half bad, either!</review-text>

		<review-text>Wow, I really enjoyed this movie. The plot was simple but the story line was thought provoking. It could have used a bit more action scenes, especially highlighting the special weapons but the visuals were awesome. Somewhat cliche' and corny laughs but I never got bored and I was glued to the screen. My favorite Marvel movie.</review-text>

		<review-text>Easily one of the best Marvel movies I've ever seen. It had multi-dimensional characters and emotional depth, some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, amazing visuals and soundtrack, and was well-acted. Chadwick Boseman's character had a heart of gold. I particularly liked that this one had a villian you could understand, compared to generic bad guys who just want to destroy the world for no reason.Probably the best Marvel movie yet.</review-text>

		<review-text>Just watched Black Panther... Initial thoughts are that this was a great film. Few things I'd have changed though. Namely I'd have liked to see certain characters survive. But the story while typical of many superhero films was excecuted exceedingly well. Also the final conflict relied very heavily on cg, but I don't think I'd call it a negative as this is a comic based movie. I brought my eldest, Ashlee and she LOVED it. Black Panther and the denziens of Wakanda, while entirely fictional, felt real in a way that made the fantasy of it all come to life in a spectacular way much like Spiderman Homecoming did. One of my favorite moments is seeing the rhino riders. Also the mid credit scene is perfect. I am looking forward to a new era of the MCU with T'Challa heavily in the forfront of it. My overall rating is 9/10This was my short spoiler free review from Facebook. But below is my spoiler filled review.
 Again SPOILERS aheadWhile the overall story is fairly generic the way it is presented makes it feel fresh in a way few MCU movies have been able to capture. Black Panther is a joy from start to finish. Many have complained about details from weak character development to overly relying on special effects. To be honest the biggest thing that this movie suffers from is being overly hyped. The media has been building this movie to to be something nearly unattainable. This movie shot for the stars and while it did not quite make it to that lofty point, Black Panther made it quite far. While this is not the first ever Black super hero stand alone film (the Blade movies come to mind and to a lesser extent Meteor Man) this is the first one to appeal to the masses. It does suffer from a few supporting characters being left wanting. Namely Forrest Whittaker's. During the duel between T'Challa and Killmonger, Forrest intervines and dies for his efforts. While the scene does show Killmongers ruthlessness it does not have a huge emotional impact. I bring it up because T'Challa reacts in such a viseral way. But the character was not built up very well. We see him a few times and most if his screen times acting as a glorified priest / ref which leads me to believe his scenes were cut short for time. Another character side story that suffers is the romance storyline. It's brief and and predicable. Enough said.Another issue I had was that they killed off Klaw Midway through the film. He is built up as the scourge of Wakanda and that he had escaped justice for 30 years after steeling a bunch Vibranium and killed many Wakandans. Klaw is captured by Black Panther and the CIA but is rescued by Kilmonger. All that only to be killed by his savior in the next screen he is shown in. Yes I understand it sets up his ability to enter Wakanda with Klaws body as his token in. I'm just fond of the character and Andy Serkis' performance was amazing. Klaw could have easily been used again in future films had they had Klaw turned over to the Wakandans crown and it could have accomplished they same outcome..The highlights are the scenes that take place in South Korea. The casino battle is bedlam in the most fun way possible. A personal favorite is during the final battle sequence. Watching the Black Panther wrestling a charging armored rhino to the ground is a thing of beauty. But the best thing about this film is that from the word go you are engrossed and when it ends you leave wanting more so that when you see that the Black Panther will return in Avengers you sigh in relief. I enjoyed seeing exactly how advanced Wakanda is and hiw the rest if the world views them. The mid credits scene that shows T'Challa and co announcing Wakanda to the UN was a perfect cap off to that. In case you are wondering how advanced they are... Well let's just say they have stuff that will make Stark blush in shame. Also Michael B. Jordan is prefect as Killmonger and really stands out in this film. But the women if this movie is where the heart and soul is really found. Like last year's Wonder Woman it just further proves that women are capable of holding a action film together. Boseman was good as T'Challa but was not the emotional core. See this movie suffered from the Avengers 4 looming in the distance since we all know he survives. But during the films climax you feel genuine fear for the fates of several characters outside of T'Challa.I love movies and most of all I love superhero movies and this movie was awesome. Go see it!Sidenote: and this should go with out saying but if you are racist then you most likely will not enjoy yourself.</review-text>

		<review-text>We finally get a peek behind the curtain at the mythical Wakanda, a nation and its protector the Black Panther, that have been hinted at and built up since Age of Ultron (or even earlier, if you count the Easter egg in Iron Man 2), and while this film does not fail to provide us with great action scenes and vibrant culture scenes, as well as probably the most interesting Marvel villain since Loki in Killmonger, I can't help but feel slightly disappointed.Don't get me wrong: every scene with Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa is near perfect, both inside the Black Panther suit and out.His story in this film picks up a short time after the events of Captain America: Civil War, where his father King T'Chaka was killed in Vienna, and T'Challa must ascend to the throne of Wakanda. But, other forces are pushing him in a darker direction, and he must choose what kind of a king he must be.The film shines whenever we get to see T'Challa interact with his fellow cast members. Whether it be with Forrest Whittaker's character, Zuri, an elder statesman and friend of T'Chaka, or T'Challa's sister Shuri, played beautifully by Letitia Wright, Chadwick Boseman seems to have good chemistry with just about everyone.The film also boasts a great villain in Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger. While his performance may feel only a hair more than one-note, his character development and motivations are some of the most compelling in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Much like Loki, the conflict derives from a family connection. Unlike Loki, his cause is something you can actually see yourself supporting to some degree.Where this film falters, at least in my view, is in the seeming lack of character development in almost anyone else in the film. Aside from T'Challa, his friend and ex-lover Nakia, played by Lupita Nyong'o, is the only one who has an easily identifiable character arc. Everyone else seems to stay in their own little bubbles, which is fine for some, but those who probably should have developed but didn't is a little frustrating.Also lacking is the seeming paint-by-numbers of the whole thing. The action scenes are impressive and there are the occasional jokes that land almost always, but it just feels a little too self-serious in its delivery, and when it tries to be light-hearted or semi-silly (mainly the scenes with Andy Serkis's Ulysses Klaue) it's jarring to say the least, mostly because it feels very forced.Nevertheless, this film is without a doubt a culturally important film, and true to form the Marvel Cinematic Universe has yet to produce a truly bad film. However, I still rank Captain America: The Winter Soldier and the first Iron Man ahead of this one.</review-text>

		<review-text>I liked this film. The action looked nice, better than the action in Thor: The Dark World and in Ant-Man. The acting was pretty good, it really seemed like the actors cared. 
But the main problem is that this is meant to be an origin story but it really doesn't feel like it, we still don't know a lot about Black Panther and HOW he got his suit. 
I still don't feel like all of the hype is justified, but it's not as bad as Thor: The Dark World. 
The villain is not as good as people say he is, he is not that intimidating which most of the GOOD Marvel villains are. Loki was threatening and funny, he was not. 
It feels like your average Marvel movie, and that's ok! 
If you like Marvel, watch it. You'll like it. 
But don't be close minded enough to think that this is good just because it has black people in a non-racist way. If you want black people in that sort of scenario watch: The Incredibles (Frozone is a side character but super funny!), Pulp Fiction (SLJ was amazing!), Moonlight (wonderful LGBTQ movie!), The Dark Knight Trilogy (Morgan Freeman is wonderful), and so many more! Don't let this average movie blind your criticism of black people, positive or negative.</review-text>

		<review-text>I almost love the film, The Black Panther. It's visuals are stunning, the CGI is wonderful, the cinematography is sumptuous, and the acting is really good...and then there's Michael B. Jordan. 
To say I was disappointed with his acting is a vast understatement. I get that he's supposed to be angry, vindictive, etc. But Jordan's interpretation of his character was like watching some bad '70's black revenge flick. It was all about being from the hood, and the whole 'we're an oppressed people' attitude that really sinks Jordan's acting and the reasoning for his taking the throne. 
For a character who is supposed to be so educated, so highly trained, he only came across as an angry man who is only out for revenge. Add in the ridiculous and incongruous fact that, despite all his anger throughout the film, he suddenly reverts to a contemplative man who says he always wanted to see the beautiful Wakandan sunsets his dad had spoken of years previously as he sat dying near the films' conclusion.
Such a change in a character is either terrible acting, bad scriptwriting, bad directing or editing, or a combination of all three. Jordan is a decent actor, but his performance in the Black Panther is just terrible and completely detracts from the film as a whole. Too bad. This movie could have been spectacular.</review-text>

		<review-text>I had high expectations for this film after I saw Black Panther appear in Civil War. Unfortunately this movie fell way short of being a good Marvel movie. I'm not sure what the critics watched, but this movie does not deserve a near perfect score. I usually don't review movies but I saw on rotten tomatoes that the majority of reviews were 5 stars from people who hadn't seen the movie yet.Story: I was happy to see the setting of Africa and the city of Wakanda. It was fresh and had the potential to be anything it wanted to be. However the pace of the movie and the character arks and motivations didn't sit well with me throughout the movie.CGI got spotty really quick, especially during the last fight scene which was disappointing because at the very least the movie lead to the one climatic fight.The woman general that is always besides black panther was my favorite character by far. It seemed like she is the only character that got any sort of development.Music really broke immersion for me. the transitions from a beat oriented or suspenseful sound to African calls and more tribal music was such a stark difference you almost want to cringe. It seems they only played that music when showing the viewer that the setting had returned to Africa.</review-text>

But, it was replaced with other satisfying elements that any movie goer would enjoyy. I will say that I wished Michael B Jordan's part displayed a little more depth.

		<review-text>I can't believe all the other reviewers giving 1 and 2 stars, I dont know whether they are trolls or not but it almost seems they are not giving it a chance.Black Panther continues with Marvel's awesome track record of good films. But this one plays out more like a shakespearean tale rather than a superhero movie, which is good. The action sequences are the films weakest point, the political drama playing out being more interesting. This is in part helped by Killmonger character, Michael B Jordan totally rocking in this role. But he is not used to his full potential, I wanted to see more of him. Also having fun with his character is non-CGI Andy Serkis who looks like a genuine badass. All the others are pretty good too. Surprisingly this is one Marvel movie where they have toned down on the comedy making it seem the stakes are high and not something to be joked over. This is complimented with the awesome soundtrack which moves you and cheer for the kiing.</review-text>

	<review id="643">
		<review-text>&quot;Black Panther&quot; is a new American movie that makes it quite comfortably past the 2-hour mark and here we have the most recent addition to the Marvel universe as in the face of the topic of racism that is still oh so dominant (really more than it should be as we are living in very tolerant times) we get the first Black superhero movie in a long time. Ryal Coogler directs and he is also part of the writing squad. I would say that by including a main antagonist here that is also Black they took some racial tension out here, but if you look at the political history of America and the Black Panthers, it may not be the wisest move to go with this animal. Besides, I felt there was far from sufficient elaboration why they did. The dream sequence with the father being a panther now that he is dead alone wasn't enough for sure. Another slightly contreoversial decision that the main antagonist is an American megalomaniac was not the most sensitive either. But luckily, there are also enough positive things to mention here. Technically, the film is on a pretty high level in terms of sound and visual effects, there is no reason to say it isn't on par with other Marvel stuff from recent history. Also the film shows that you don't need characters from previous Marvel films to succeed the way they included Hulk most recently in Thor 3. And Boseman in the lead does a pretty good job like everybody else almost, certainly better than Cumberbatch for example. The one exception here is Kaluuya whose character did almost nothing for me and whose performance rang pretty false too on several occasions. The one who made up for that was Andy Serkis, who was great fun to watch and perhaps the best thing about the movie, one of not too manby white performers here, who were mostly included for comedic (not entirely) situations. This description also fits Martin Freeman's role and he was the same as usual sadly, but luckily his material was good without being too challenging, so it worked. Not the Freeman you'd expect in this film though is he.From the Black cast, a special mention goes out to Winston Duke who was really hilarious and makes the most of the little (screen time) he was given here. His cannibalism/vegetarianism joke was perhaps the best (recurring) joke the entire film had to offer. Michael B. Jordan was a good main antagonist I think, even if he seemed a bit insignificant ear´ly on, but that's okay. He sure is no Andy Serkis. The film's weakest moment was the epilogue that we got here the way we got it in every Marvel movie where we have the King tell the press that his counmtry will no longer ignore global conflicts and this went entirely against everything before that as one of the key messages here was that they do nor want to be involved while the bad guy wants to use the country's ressources to dominate the world. It was simply wrong. Obviously this was done so that they could include Black Panther in other upcoming Marvel films like the next Avengers movie, but probably others as well. Very cheap and if that's one of the things you remember the most when leaving the theater, then that is almost a negative deal breaker. But luckily most of what we saw earlier was good enough, especially the shots at comedy that never felt as wrong or try-hard as in an Iron Man film (sorry RDJ), for me to still recommend the watch here. There are nonetheless serious issues here like the way the protagonist recovers so unrealistically quickly after his defeat and honestly this really felt like taken from Batman's conflict with Bane and he cannot defeat the bad guy at the peak of his physical fitness before that, but then he wins afterward after being in a coma recently? Nah guys. The female amazon tribe story added nothing for me either. So overall, realism, authenticity and convincing character elaborations are an issue here and the final scene in America about that apartment felt really try-hard in making a political impact and the film is never touching or politically relevant from the contemporary perspective as it wants to be, but it is like other recent Marvel films okay from the pointless fun perspective. I give it a thumbs-up. Worth checking out, but not a must-see by any means.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther presents outstanding visuals very much in tune with the Marvel cinematic universe. And whilst Director Ryan Coogler does an all-things-considered decent job of bringing a more considered, relevant and thought-provoking tale to the popcorn thrill dominated Marvel film repertoire. He fails in every other aspect. Whilst striving so hard to bring a 'minority' people to the ticket booth - all 2 billion as they say in the movie - he has done a tasteless disservice to white africans, allowing dialogue such as &quot;colonists&quot; and &quot;another white person that needs fixing&quot; to permeate the film. This somewhat racist leaning language is interspersed by easily the most stereotypical and completely absurd wannabe African accents from actors with no idea how to do it correctly. Compounding this is Hollywood's go-to bad guy in all things African, the big, white, Afrikaans accented man that eventually gets killed, but not before telling how awful the people of an African country are. Capitalising on yet another poor stereotype is the Wakandan's use of armoured Rhinoceroses, because nothing says conservation of an almost entirely extinct species with poor eyesight like strapping armour to it and charging it into battle. 
White guilt with no substance, which is why of course it has been lauded by critics, who know so little of Africa, yet have spoken so much.</review-text>

		<review-text>The title put is not to bring any form of offense to African-Americans/ Africans since while watching the movie, I never felt about the racial element in the movie, that people keep pin-pointing, but the overall performance by all the actors in the movie. This is another amazing piece from Marvel universe with Black Panther making an impact in the class of superhero movies. The background story is amazing and so was the action till the very end. The part before interval flows slow but picks from the first action sequence on-wards. I observed that all the actors which not only the lead actors but also the supporting roles &amp; extras really jumped in to make a Marvel Movie. Good job by the director Ryan Coogler to craft a wonderful movie that not only consists of just action sequence, but message about the African tribe how much significance they emphasize on vibranium and safeguarding it from evil purposes. Boseman and Jordan were exceptional in their roles as well. This is a good flick from Marvel that you would love watching at least once.</review-text>

		<review-text>This movie entertained me for two hours and exactly that was my expectation. Marvel movies arent doing anything spectacularly cool anymore, but they deliver on action and effects. I feel though, as that CGI could use another leap forward in technology. I am starting to get too used to it and spotting it is getting easier and easier and that just takes one out of the immersion.About the &quot;controversy&quot;: I think those groups that hype the movie for their black background are equally annoying as those that bash it for the overhype.

The Acting was superb and really brought the characters to life and made them very memorable, I loved just about every character, they really focused on the cohesiveness of the unit as a team rather than just making it about black panther. The action scenes were fantastic and the visuals were breathtakingly stunning. The antagonist and protagonist had a meaningful perspective that was very relatable to reality and delivered a powerful message. The dialogue was great and delivered some very powerful lines. The music score was amazing as all the scenes were very fluid and really hit home. Asher Samuel</review-text>

I didn't know Wakanda was so ahead of the world with technology, or any of the character lore. Yes, this is kind of an origin story, but it's done in a way that it doesn't necessarily feel like it. The scenery is beautiful, and the characters are great. The women really kick butt, and the villains are very good. Andy Serkis especially seems to have a lot of fun with his role. I didn't really expect humour, but as with Marvel tradition, there is a good amount as well.

		<review-text>I can consider myself as a big fan of Marvel Cinematic Universe. In my opinion the phase 1 was boring, the phase 2 was fine and the phase 3 is being amazing.
I didn't know nothing about Black Panther before to watch it, but this movie is the proof of how great a PG-13 super hero film can be. The main story is really good, has small twists to keep the interest and memorable characters to make every single scene epic.Some of the most points I love are: the costumes &amp; the characters design (the creators deserve a nomination for the next Oscars), the action sequences are all incredible (the scene in South Korea is one of the best I've seen in a action film), and the soundtrack is amazing.Rating: 8.5/10I know it's an important masterpiece for the African people and I'm happy to see how Marvel could handle it with success. Now I hope they do movies with more people from different races, female leaders, and also with gay, bisexual and lesbian super heroes.
By the way, don't expect anything awesome for the credits scenes, they're just okay.</review-text>
		<review-title>The king of the Marvel Universe</review-title>
	</review>
	<review id="654">
		<review-text>The fight for the crown of Wakanda is wonderfully brought to life in this bristling film about T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) and his rise to power as king of Wakanda in the aftermath of returning to his home country and his subsequent struggle for his position when he is challenged by his rival Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan in an authoritative performance) whose father was killed by accident by his father a generation earlier.First, the extraordinary visual effects. This sheer visual aspect of the film held my attention before I was sold on the film's underlying story. Even if you don't go for this sort of movie as a genre, you should nevertheless see it because its visuals demand being seen on screen. The film's stunning and lush realization of Wakanda alone is worth the price of admission.Then, there is the powerful story of two viciously competing visions for the place of Wakanda in the world and confronting injustice and oppression against its people. This film becomes a surprisingly gripping debate between confrontation and pragmatism, between vindictiveness and conciliation. Killmonger and T'Challa come to epitomize the conflicting philosophies battling for the leadership of Wakanda. In that regard, it's a great political Marvel film as well.I was impressed by how the whole cast gave this film so much vitality. Although Michael B. Jordan is somewhat underused in the beginning, his presence becomes more paramount and he shapes the film more and more as it goes along. Boseman is tremendously heroic and sympathetic in the title role. This is a Marvel blockbuster to remember when the dust settles. Strongly recommended.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is an amazing addition to the Marvel cinema efforts. This movie offers the most diverse cast and an interesting story line that fictitiously imagines an Africa without colonization by focusing on a hidden country. We currently live during a time when Africa has been completely gutted by European nations making Africa unstable in some countries. Black Panther captures the beauty of Africa, from the costumes inspired by various tribes, warriors, etc. protecting their valuable resources. Think about gold, diamonds, oil, and uranium and the many other precious metals of Africa and what has become of the countries where these resources exist. I read a comment on IMDb that described the film as divisive. When we take into account major blockbuster hits like The Great Wall with Matt Damon, God's of Egypt, Johnny Depp in Lone Ranger, and Jake Gyllenhal in Prince of Persia (To name only a few), these are all movies that we should consider divisive, especially when the main roles that should star native Americans, Iranians, Egyptians, and Chinese actors but star American white men, Black Panther is a breath of fresh air. I believe this film was only an introduction to the characters. We will and should see more. This is amazing film! Worth seeing it more than once.</review-text>

		<review-text>Not quite sure what to expect with this movie. I just did not want to see a politicized movie about the current state of affairs in this country. And it definitely is not that at all! I'm tired of Hollywood, the writers, directors, and the actors with their opinions on anything at all!
This movie had nothing to do with any of that. It was well written, plenty of action, and you really liked all the characters in the movie, even the bad guys for a change. Thank You!</review-text>

		<review-text>One of the few times I made time for an Opening Weekend movie and it was completely worth the lines. Great script, great acting and special effects. It will be a challenge bringing Panther into the rest of the Marvel World which is dominated by CAP &amp; Iron Man but hopefully they will try. Watched this with family and everyone truly enjoyed all aspects. Great Job Marvel and director Ryan Coogler.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther is amazing and extremely entertaining. I have NO agenda, political or otherwise. I am an avid movie goer, 10 to 15 times a month, and I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. Can't wait to see again. Politics never crossed my mind. Actually, if you think this movie is below standard, most likely THOSE comments are politically-inspired. Again, extremely good cinema!! Thank you Marvel!</review-text>

		<review-text>There are many one and two star reviews of &quot;Black Panther&quot; here on IMDB, and from reading them one must surmise that the reviewers have not seen the movie, but have a political agenda to forward. Because this is without a doubt the best Marvel Universe movie yet...filled with incredible action, writing, acting, CGI and a strong message of hope for not just the African-American community but for all Americans, and all citizens of the world. I strongly recommend this movie, and congratulate everyone who participated in its making. Lastly...and this is not a spoiler...but do NOT leave the theater when the credits begin to roll. There are two important scenes that you don't want to miss!</review-text>

		<review-text>You would be hard pressed to find another 2018 film that has as much cultural and societal significance as Black Panther. A giant blockbuster comic book film, with a (nearly) all black cast, black writers, and a black director. If you have ever questioned whether representation on screen is truly important, just look at the philanthropic movements surrounding this movie. With the &quot;Black Panther Challenge&quot;, money is being raised so that black youths--who could not afford to see it themselves--can go watch the film. The amount of love surrounding this movie almost matches the film's own innate messages, and it shows just how powerful the medium of film can be. This is exactly why movies are made. So while we take the time to discuss and analyze the film, it's important to have this preface of the significance of this movie, as that is far more important in the long run than all the tiny details and Easter Eggs Marvel fans will pick apart and debate. With that said, Black Panther is a really great movie. It personally is not in my top five Marvel Cinematic Universe movies like it is for some people, but it is a great film that stands out as being one of the more unique entries into the MCU, mainly due to Ryan Coogler's direction...

		<review-text>Black panther was EXCELLENT and AMAZING, a movie that has somehow managed to capture and display so many of the rarely touched on thoughts, ideas, desires and needs of all people, from ancient times to our present, especially those of us who are of color. This movie portrays and expresses some things that are very rarely seen or heard of in any movies that we presently see on tv or in theaters. Black men in power successfully leading others, respected intelligent and creative Black women, Black people working together to achieve things, sharing technology, key phrases that are prophetic to those who understand the changes that are occurring right now in our world. This movie itself is a multi-layered anomaly that terrifies some who understand the power of movies and music to influence real world societies. YES, it is exceptionally entertaining and definitely stirs the pots of racial biases, cracking and reforming the molds of what we are used to seeing and hearing on our screens. This movie is blazing a whole new path to the future and opening minds of the money makers to new ideas being possible and profitable. This is why &quot;the haters&quot; are doing everything they can including falsely rating the movie poorly, to stop people from seeing this movie. THIS MOVIE IS JUST THAT GOOD. GO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF, and enjoy a glimpse into the future expansion of movies and music to come. Of course Black Panther isn't to be avoided or feared... unless... you're one of the bad guys... if so... your fear will be your downfall... BLACK PANTHER IS HERE ... The concepts, the ideas and the movie. Long live Wikanda.</review-text>

		<review-text>I went to see Black Panther on Sunday the 18th, the 3rd day of its release. I wanted to go see it on Saturday but all the Theaters near me were sold out. It would then take me hours of searching online before I was able to secure a ticket for the next available showing in my neighborhood, which would be the next day (Sunday) afternoon, a show that would also sale out by late afternoon on Saturday. As I was doing the searching though it suddenly hit me that I had NEVER, EVER done this before! Being a middle aged woman of African origin but one who grew up in the States, this was the first time I was actually feeling this inspired to go see a movie on its release and would invest this much time, energy, and resources to do so. A bitter/sweet realization naturally follows &quot;wow, this is what representation feels like.&quot; I was obviously happy to have this seemingly basic experience but sad that it would take 50 years of my life to get there. 
On Sunday, come show time, it was hard not to notice the buzz/excitement in the room full of people waiting impatiently for the film to start. For a moment, it reminded me of the time when President Obama was elected in 2008 - there was a brief period there when we were collectively elevated to this place of unity, where differences having to do with race/gender/nationality etc. seemed insignificant compared to the milestone that had just been achieved. A similar feeling was there in the theater. The film clearly represented the forces that unites and elevate. 
With regards to the movie itself, being new to the whole Comics/Super-Hero/Marvel world, I did not know what to expect. So I was pleased when following the adverts, Black Panther started quietly and with familiar faces and on familiar territory. Soon though, began to emerge, one after the other, these Black, Beautiful, Powerful, Graceful, Masterful characters, garbed in never before seen colorful and magical, tribal yet futuristic outfits (some resembling the Masai people,) in this fantastical land that is at once futuristic, highly Scientifically/Technologically advanced, and yet at the same time has managed to remain grounded in its ancient and tribal roots/ways. The cast selection was simply impeccable. Chadwick Bosman was a perfect pick for a King. His cool temperament and charisma coupled with his physical/mental/emotional/spiritual strength made him outstanding! The women in the rolls of Shuri/Nakia/Okoye/the Queen Mother and the whole Dora Milaje were phenomenal! From their physiques, to their masterly warrior skills, to their loyalty and love for their people and the country, to their fabulous costumes and accents, they present a wonderful array of what is black-feminine-beautiful-strong-fully evolved/mature- and committed.
The movie is packed with powerful visuals, action, and content. It offers so much that is new and different on so many levels. So, naturally my fist viewing experience was overwhelmed with just taking in the visuals and keeping up with the action as best as I could. The dense content will take time and hopefully more viewings to untangle. Overall, Black Panther, not only did it not disappoint, it inspired, it united, it healed, and I have to say after this introduction to Marvel I will now be on the lookout for similar releases in the future!</review-text>

		<review-text>Do not go to this movie tired or you will fall asleep! If you enjoy a highly predictable plot, awkward character personalities, no background on characters, boring fight scenes, subpar visual graphics, &amp; long strung out movies, then the Black Panther is for you! The black panther appears to be a distasteful mix of Iron Man and Batman with a splash of cat woman and wolverine that flat out does nothing &quot;cool&quot;. The popularity of this movie is being derived from social issues in our culture today. The Black Panther does a wonderfully awful job at bringing cultures together but rather tears them father apart. DO NOT waste your money like I did. You're Welcome.</review-text>

		<review-text>Despite hate groups trying to stage fights to scare people away, or giving low ratings on Rotten tomatoes, the audience ignored them and went to see this movie in droves. Hate could not keep people away.The Kings were regal, the women fierce, the story complex.In American schools, black kids are taught to be embarrassed or ashamed of their African-American ancestry. It takes years to be untaught such racism. This movie lifts them up and shows them as the proud, intelligent and strong people they are. Kids today now have something to make them feel proud of where they came from.One mistake in film: &quot;It's our time to be on top&quot; line should have been delivered as, &quot;Our time to be on top AGAIN,&quot; or &quot;Back on Top.&quot; There was a time were they ruled the earth; even an African King was a Pharaoh.</review-text>

		<review-text>'Black Panther (2018)' does portray a perspective so often missing from mainstream media and is refreshing because of it, a vibrant and celebratory vision of an oft overlooked culture infused with the sci-fi futurism inherent to the genre. The story at its core is a more typical superhero sort of fare that's pretty predictable and ultimately very safe, though, despite some decent character motivations. It feels very long, too, and the effects are overbearing at times. When the CGI rhinos turned up, the flick kind of lost me. The digital body doubles both look dodgy and do some dodgy things, taking away from the believability of a hero who was incredibly tangible and entertainingly combat-capable in his debut appearance. Its good, enjoyable stuff but boils down to things we've seen before, no less valid because of it but also not entirely groundbreaking either. 7/10</review-text>

		<review-text>'Black Panther' is co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler and stars Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa aka Black Panther, the title character. Following 'Captain America: Civil War', T'Challa returns to his home of Wakanda, a secret technologically advanced nation. Given his Father's demise in 'Civil War' he is to take his rightful place as King of Wakanda until unexpected adversaries surface which threaten not only his place on the throne but the fate of Wakanda itself. For the most part 'Black Panther' is fun, exciting and sometimes even funny and features excellent performances from a terrific ensemble cast. However, it is not without its problems which for me prevent it from being a top tier MCU entry. First of all it seems in an attempt to side step the very well known villain problem in the MCU, director Coogler has actually shot himself in the foot and created one the most irritating and drab villains in this universe namely Eric Kilmonger. Michael B Jordan's performance as Kilmonger doesn't help either which is over done and at times a harbinger of cringe. The fault of this character is also due in part to the screenplay which leaves him out of it for almost an hour after his introduction. Honestly after his first scene had passed I completely forgot about him and was almost lead to believe that Klau (Andy Serkis) was the main antagonist of the film. Despite his motivations being more understandable than most mustache twirling villains in the MCU, the execution of the character is rather disappointing and a big misfire.Now that the glaring problem is out of the way there are also some minor issues worthy of mention. The CGI looks unfinished in some places particularly in the big action set pieces toward the end. At one point Black Panther and Kilmonger look like video game creations when they fighting in mid air. This probably sounds like I am trashing this film but I actually do like it quite a bit overall, I just felt it necessary to point out the wildly obvious missteps that a lot of people seem to be missing or blissfully ignoring. For example, Letitia Wright as Shuri, T'Challa's tech wizard sister, is a revelation not only as comic relief but as vital character to much of the film's plot. Lupita N'yongo also does good work here as T'Challa's love interest. Chadwick Boseman impresses again as T'challa, following on from his small but standout role in 'Civil War', proving a very charasmatic lead. Andy Serkis is also great here looking like he's having all the fun in the world and stealing every scene he's in reprising his character from 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. So all in all 'Black Panther' is a decent upper mid tier entry in the MCU with some issues that prevent it from being one of the best that this universe has to offer.</review-text>

		<review-text>I loved. Like i said it's one of a few good MCU movie. Not so comedic. Enough. And battle scenes were great. But about villain there weren't so much scenes about him. They could've given him more play. And of course there were cliche scenes. But like i said it's one of a few good MCU movies. At least not joke like Thor Ragnarok. And what i like is there weren't so much feminism element that ruined the movie like it did on Thor Ragnarok and everything else.</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther should be rated somewhere in the middle of the Marvel origin stories. I feel that as far as the origin stories go, they seem to follow a pattern that goes something like this: The top origins were funny, and serious, had action, interesting characters, smart dialogue and a decent story line. The worst were long, slow and little action or most of the action was at the end. I would suggest that &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; and &quot;Deadpool&quot; were tied for #1 as the best of the origins, while &quot;Thor&quot; and &quot;Fantastic 4&quot; were arguably two of the worst. The first &quot;Iron Man&quot; was somewhere near the top but &quot;Captain America&quot; was probably closer to the bottom. &quot;Wolverine's&quot; origins was probably somewhere in the middle, since people seem to love it or hate it. The rest are all sprinkled somewhere in between. (Sorry if I left some out and being true to the comic story line was not considered since that is a measure mostly for true comic book fans). Black Panther has a decent story line, good villains (but kill of a colorful one early), but is rather slow at times and is light on the action until the end. This movie has patterns of both the best and worst origin stories. It is not the best but it is certainly not the worst. It's somewhere in the middle.What is most unfortunate for those of us that really want to like this movie was the stupid levels of super-over-hype by the media and critics. .</review-text>

		<review-text>If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Black Panther is the last Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) entry before the highly expected Avengers: Infinity War and it tells the story of T'Challa's (Chadwick Boseman) rise to become King of Wakanda.Right after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther returns to the isolated nation of Wakanda, but an old enemy reappears and the King's throne is put to the test. A conflict ensues and the fate of the whole world becomes in danger.Black Panther is one of my most anticipated films of this year (you can check the list HERE) and I couldn't wait to watch it on an IMAX theater. I loved Boseman's presence in Civil War and his action sequences were amazing, so I was super excited to see what his origin movie could bring to the MCU.Well, it is undoubtedly one of the best in the franchise and its place on the top one-third of the MCU is certainly guaranteed. It has a very heartfelt and culturally significant screenplay. This carries an even bigger weight than Wonder Woman did because for the first time in the cinema history, a film with not only a black lead superhero but with a 95% black cast (only two white characters), shines through with an emotional story.The script is remarkably well-written. It has a lot of references to the real world but in the opposite way: Wakanda is more technologically advanced than the rest of the world and for once, black people are not the ones falling behind. I love this aspect of the movie, Ryan Coogler cleverly portrays a world where things are not as everyone thinks they are. This film is demonstrative of how to flawlessly build a world in a cinematic universe.Also an example of perfection, the casting is phenomenal! Marvel never fails in getting the absolute best actors and actresses to portray their respective roles, either these being the lead hero or a secondary character. Everyone has terrific performances, but some are worth mentioning in detail.I will not even start with Boseman. Firstly, I have to write about Michael B. Jordan and his interpretation of the villain, Erik Killmonger. Jordan is incredible, there isn't a single scene where he doesn't shine and he elevates his character. That said, Killmonger is by far the best villain since the beginning of everything (Iron Man (2008)).His compelling journey makes the audience care for him and his beliefs are very true to his heart. He is what he thinks the people need him to be in order for everyone to be able to live freely and protected from the &quot;bad guys&quot; running the world. His backstory is very tragic and it sets up a dilemma between him and T'Challa. Erik is notably well-developed and Coogler does a wonderful job co-writing him with Joe Robert Cole.Chadwick Boseman is right up there as well. He fully embodies his character, nailing the accent and making every interaction that he shares with his family or his close friends feel so realistic and full of emotion. T'Challa is an exceptional protagonist, it is easy to stand behind him since his motivations are genuine and passionate. He wants the best for his people and he wants to be an even better King than his father, by trying to correct his past mistakes.I don't even consider T'Challa and Killmonger as the hero and the villain, respectively. Each character has their own perspective and their reasons are both solid, so when the time for their head-to-head comes, I can't really choose a side. Coogler and Cole brilliantly write the characters' script and each one has their own reasons to support either Boseman or Jordan's characters. This is why this movie probably has the best characters in the whole MCU.Lupita Nyong'o beautifully portrays Nakia, a warrior that doesn't rely on tradition that much as she also wants to see the poor people around the world with a better quality of life. Danai Gurira (Okoye) is a badass and her character is also very well-developed, plus she has some cool action sequences. I also would like to congratulate Andy Serkis (Ulysses Klaue) for his excellent over-the-top performance, as well as Daniel Kaluuya (W'Kabi), Letitia Wright (super funny as Shuri) and Martin Freeman (Everett K. Ross).Actually, Ross was one of the characters that I left the theater wondering if he was really necessary. Being the only white person in Wakanda, I took a while to fully understand his role. Truthfully, he doesn't introduce or helps to develop any other character and he only has one or two scenes to shine. However, he is important to the cultural value of the film! He is the personification of the rest of the world, he thinks he is several steps ahead of T'Challa and his people, but Freeman ends up being the ignorant of Wakanda's greatness.Like I wrote earlier, this is one of the best installments of the MCU. Culturally, it means a lot and the story has a lot of substance. The cinematography looks gorgeous, the nation of Wakanda is very well designed through CGI and the editing is great throughout the whole runtime. The epic score is one of the highlights. A lot of praise has been given to Kendrick Lamar for the rap vibe that he implements in the movie, but nothing beats the African traditional sounds that elevate not only the action scenes but every single moment.Nevertheless, this film is not perfect. While its tone is well-balanced, its pacing not so much. The first act drags too much and it feels that some scenes could have been left out. From the first ritual battle onwards, the movie starts getting its pace right and the entertainment level gets higher. However, the plot follows a predictable path and it ends up on a disappointing note ... Coogler doesn't do good directing the most important action scene.The CGI might be very good and it is indeed well-controlled during the film, but it is misused in the climactic fight at the end. I mean, the first ritual battle between T'Challa and (at the time) a random character is way more exciting and better filmed (good handling of the shaky cam and the water splashes effects are pretty cool) than the supposedly epic showdown with Killmonger. Leaving the theater disappointed with the fight is never a good sign, especially when there are so many awesome action moments during the film. Apart from this, a couple of exposition scenes could have been told in a better way, but these are all minor issues that I have with one of the best superhero movies in the most recent years.All in all, Black Panther lives up to the hype and it does not fail. With an extraordinary cast, Boseman and Jordan lead a very heartfelt and emotional story, filled with fantastic characters and beautiful world-building. Killmonger is the absolute standout as the best villain of the entire MCU, the script is on-point for every character and the plot is very well-written, even if it becomes predictable. Technically great, but not flawless. While the cinematography, the editing and mainly the score elevate the film, the first act's slow pacing and the extremely disappointing climactic battle between the two leads bring down the movie, ending it on a bittersweet note. Still, this is surely in the top one-third of the MCU and I can't wait for Avengers: Infinity War!</review-text>

		<review-text>Black Panther was a really well made movie which I fairly enjoyed. The general story was really good for a intro arc to the MCU, and had a good balance with humor. Now the villian Killmonger was very well acted by Michael B Jordan and it's very sad to see him die as it felt like the movie didn't show a lot of him in it. The problems I had with this movie were some of the fight scenes in the beginning and one at the end. The ones in the beginning were too fast paced and you had no idea what was going on. The one at the end when Black Panther is fighting Killmonger, at one point they seem very cartoonish and it makes the scene look rigid and not agile (or catlike). Sometimes it was also hard to know what they were saying due to accent but you still got the general idea of what they were trying to say. I was very excited for this movie but I feel like it was over-hyped. There wasn't a lot of action and the director saying that it would be the James Bond of the MCU was not shown in this movie at all. It felt more of a Lion King story where T'Challa must fight for the throne. It did make me close to crying at 2 points in the movie but never did it it make me butt clench in the action scenes. I will still rate this movie a solid 8/10!</review-text>

		<review-text>Looks like there are some folks trying to keep this movie down. (Russian Hackers? Fox News?) I doubt that much will come of this campaign. This film handles its business and leaves little doubt that it has. I'm not saying it's perfect but by super hero blockbuster standards, it definitely exceeds expectations. The writers/director (Coogler and Cole) have actually taken the time to write the actioner you want along with a fleshed out, exceedingly thoughtful and wonderfully relevant story, the likes of which have rarely graced this genre. This comic book myth may have been hatched in '62 alongside the emergence of the 'Black Panther' movement but this film announces that the social ideas and dreams, that were always that movement's subtext, remains alive. If you only know the 'Panthers' as a violent, revolutionary group, then you don't know the 'Black Panthers'. (I recommend the PBS documentary)Boswick is an excellent choice for T'Challa aka 'The Black Panther'. He's crafted an understated hero which suits his humility as great warrior and compassionate king. Michael B. Jordan aka 'Erik Killmonger' has come a long way since his days on The Wire and with good reason. He's truly become a wonderful, sensitive and intense actor which is on full display here. His portrayal is fully four dimensional having some ask whether he would have been a better Black Panther. Really, the entire cast goes all out to make this a human experience.Overall, the special effects are good with only a few over-the-top CGI moments and obligatory choreo-fights. This film isn't so much about the action (Don't worry. It's in there.) as it is about establishing the myth and proposing another way of seeing and being. AND the message isn't just for people of color.No spoilers today. Wouldn't want to undermine the experience in any way.8.5 stars!</review-text>

		<review-text>Some preliminary remarks: overhyping a pop culture film into the second coming of Martin Luther King or (fitting for the title) Malcolm X never does any good, although a lot of the themes of the American civil rights movement resonate in the conflict of T'Challa and Killmonger.The film has a five act structure, which is a nice change of pace for an MCU release. The first act is mainly expository and world-building and gives an intriguing view of the nation of Wakanda. The place looks gorgeous although it is entirely CG. I am still not sure why the Wakandans have chosen to remain hidden for so long. The second act is action-packed and has the best fight scene of the entire film, the casino in Busan in South Korea. It is a signature move of Ryan Coogler to keep one long camera shot on the fight without cutting away (cf. his work in &quot;Creed&quot;).Both third and fourth acts are more drama than action, especially the fourth act, building up the villain of T'Challa, his cousin Killmonger. His motives are believable but Michael B. Jordan does not give his best performance here in my view (especially if you remember him in &quot;Creed&quot;, in which he was phenomenal). It was during these two acts where I lost interest a bit in the film, especially after Klauwe got killed. He was the far superior villain and this is mainly due to the phenomenal acting of Andy Serkis. Give this man more live action roles! In general, I found the acting performances to be Ok for an MCU film but nothing outstanding.The final act is all action, with lots of CG. Most of it fell flat for me, but the metal rhinos were a neat idea. The ending was nice, with Wakanda stepping out of the shadows and onto the world's stage. All in all, another good entry to the MCU, with a much more serious story (and almost no or only mild jokes! The Anti-Thor: Ragnarok of the MCU!). Best MCU film ever? No, certainly not, at least not after my initial viewing. It reminds me of coming out of &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; but with a more meaningful story and better world-building.One thing intrigued me very much: in the second act, having all these Africans in Korea, that was a glimpse into a post-white world and I would have loved to see more Asian-African crossovers. Maybe for another time!</review-text>

		<review-text>Going into this film i just assumed that this would be your average Marvel superhero film with some social commentary tacked on, but i was actually pleasantly surprised. This is a film that, for a superhero film, is fairly unique whilst still familiar to what we love about MarvelThe film is set in a normal earth, yet on this earth is a country called Wakanda, a prosperous african nation run by several tribes who are ruled by a king known as the Black Panther. After his father's death, T'Challa takes his place as the king of the nation, however this is shortly interrupted by the arrival of an american named Erik Killmonger, who is revealed to be the son of T'Challa's uncle, killed by his father. After successfully challenging T'Challa to the throne, Killmonger plans to wage war on Earth to fight the oppression that black people face, whilst a group of T'Challa's close allies fight to stop him.On the whole, the film is an enjoyable experience. The effects are brilliant, but not too in-your-face, and this is a much more human film than a lot of other superhero movies, with lots of character interaction and bonding. The social commentary on race is well inserted and doesn't feel too overbearing in the film. The acting is superb all around, as are the overall characterizations, and overall i found it fairly difficult to really fault the film.However, whilst it does a lot of things very well, there is nothing that it does exceptionally. At no point in the film did i think 'wow, this is the best thing ever', more 'yeah this is pretty good'. Whilst a fun film to watch, it isn't really one i would watch again or remember watching in the future.Overall i would definitely recommend this film, even if you aren't a big marvel fan, as it is a well written, well acted movie that can make for thought-provoking movie - just don't go in expecting to see the greatest movie ever made.</review-text>

		<review-text>Have to admit this is the first Marvel Movie in a very long time where I didn't enjoy the plot. It's highly derivitive and largely unimaginative. The middle section rambles and the plot twists are poor and predictable.But what Black Panther has going for it is an interesting setting and an exceptional cast. Wakanda is excellently realised. Everyone has a chance to shine. Chadwick Boseman builds well on his excellent showing in Civil War, Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Guria are engaging and very impressive. But there are two big problems for me. Andy Serkis, who chews the scenery marvellously, is killed off far too soon, replaced by Michael B. Jordan's less interesting Killmonger as the main villian, and we have the old utterly predicatable trope where the main hero is believed dead for a strectch during the movie's second half. This is tired. Is anyone fooled by this? I'm also far from convinced that having Wakanda shut off for centuries from the rest of the world was the way to go. It actually made the country look hypocritical.But as I say, the acting saves it. This would have been a barely passable six out of ten but for the excellent cast. Winston Duke's M'Baku is an added bonus. He was fantastic and I hope he gets more screen time in future movies. He has the film's best gag, too.</review-text>

		<review-text>Unlike other recent Marvel movies this wasn't a joke fest. It had a great story line and introduced the character very well. The story also stand alone great so you don't need to be a Marvel fan and have seen the other MCU movies. The action was top notch like we would expect from Marvel and the acting is great too. The bad guy is being said to be a best bad guy in a comic movie. I don't know about that but he was good. Joker, doc oc, Loki and Ronin have been my favorite bad guys.</review-text>
		<review-title>Fantastic origin story for the character</review-title>

	<review id="687">
		<review-text>As a Marvel fan I expected this movie to delve into the details of where the vibranium came from, why it has special properties, the origin of the Black Panther, and whether the Soul Stone was in Wakanda or not. But they didn't go in that direction. Instead they focused on character development. Which is great. That is what most superhero movies lack. All the characters experience growth and change their beliefs as the story advances. With that said, the story is generic, just like most other Marvel movies. The villain's motivations are not explored enough to really care about him and the story is very predictable. All in all, it's a good movie. Overhyped but stil great.</review-text>

		<review-text>I don´t think this movie is bad at all. But I had a real problem even talking about this film with others since it seems like they completely reject any flaw the movie has. While it is true that you should enjoy the movie I do not think you should turn your eye away from weaker points.I had no problem with the cast in this movie and I think they worked great. The problem is that this film tries to be original while still following the marvel formula and that shows. Certain Characters does sometimes feel unique but at other times they just feel like the other supporting casts in the Marvel cinematic Universe.This also is shown in the plot. I really liked to experience wakanda and its culture but the movie jumped from that to generic action/superhero stuff and then back to the world of wakanda. And thus I felt like I had not seen enought. You barely see how the city of Wakanda looks except from above shots.The major flaw I had was the ending that did not look good at all. Since the Black panther suit is all cgi I understand that it can look fake but even the movements looked somewhat weird and unnatural. While Civil war also had Cgi, I think its effects were a lot more polished. And this exists in more parts of the film, not just the ending.I did not hate this movie. I quite liked liked it. But I am dissapointed that it did not focus on the elements that actually made the movie good and instead felt like it had to add elements to make it feel like another superhero movie.You can like this movie but do not be afraid to point out its flaw. More time polishing the effects could help and I had really hoped that they would try to make this movie feel a lot more unique.</review-text>
		<review-title>Did Black Panther meet the hype?</review-title>

		<review-text>While Wakanda is a marvel to behold, The story in Black Panther is quite generic and predictable. The action is light and far from revolutionary. The film's basic structure mimics that of 2011's Thor. Killmonger is an solid villain, although his limited screentime and certain dialogue prevents him from being the greatest but he's one of better villains The MCU has. Phase 3 overall has been much better in the villain department. The CGI painfully reminds of PS2 video games especially in the 3rd act. While the tone is more serious, it doesn't erase the fact that this film's vibranium weaving has some cracks. It's an good film but not the masterpiece being touted. The performances elevated a rather generic and predictable story. C</review-text>

		<review-text>The highly anticipated superhero film &quot;Black Panther&quot; is finally here, after a ton of hype and outstanding reviews. While I would say that the film very, very slightly does not quite live up to some of the hype, it is still well-made and thoroughly entertaining. The film's acting is stronger than one would come across in most superhero movies, highlighted by Chadwick Boseman's commanding and stylish performance as T'Challa (Black Panther.) Also noteworthy is Michael B. Jordan's role as the impressively complex villain, and the Dora Milaje--the all-female special forces unit of Wakanda (the fictional African country where much of the film takes place.)Speaking of Wakanda, director Ryan Coogler has masterfully designed and executed difficult world-building tactics to create this kingdom. The visual effects on display depicting Wakanda's unique landscapes are stunning, and it is genuinely impressive the detail that went into analyzing the kingdom's mercantile economy and political structure. Through depiction of a spear-fighting ritual as well as music, dance and food, audiences are immersed into the nation's local culture as well. These elements often make &quot;Black Panther&quot; feel more fresh than the typical superhero film.While there's undoubtedly much to like about &quot;Black Panther,&quot; the film does unfortunately contain some notable lapses. Its biggest flaw is that the climax of the movie is incredibly rushed and sometimes feels like it has trouble taking its time to tie up loose ends and plot holes. Conversely, the first act seems a bit too long. While the movie is generally well-written, the film's attempted moments of comic relief and one-liners that are effective in other Marvel movies tend to fall a bit flat here. That said, this is still a good and unique superhero film that I do recommend. 7/10Note: I saw the film in IMAX. The film's frequent use (over an hour of footage worth) of special formatting for IMAX, as well as the screen size and sound system, made this premium experience worthwhile.</review-text>
